# ArangoDB Server Encryption Options

## Keyfile

`--encryption.keyfile <path-of-keyfile>`

The file `path-to-keyfile` must contain the encryption key. This file must be
secured, so that only `arangodump`, `arangorestore`, or `arangod` can access it.
You should also ensure that in case someone steals your hardware, they will not be
able to read the file. For example, by encrypting `/mytmpfs` or
creating an in-memory file-system under `/mytmpfs`. The encryption keyfile must 
contain 32 bytes of data.

## Key Generator

`--encryption.key-generator <path-to-my-generator>`

This output is used if you want to use the program to generate your encryption key.
The program `path-to-my-generator` must output the encryption on standard output
and exit. The encryption keyfile must contain 32 bytes of data.
