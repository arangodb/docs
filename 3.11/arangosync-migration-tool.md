# Cloud Migration Tool

{{ page.description }}
{:class="lead"}

The `arangosync-migration` tool allows you to easily migrate data to the
cloud while ensuring a smooth transition with minimal downtime.
Start the cloud migration, let the tool do the job and, at the same time,
keep your local cluster up and running. 

Some of the key benefits of the cloud migration tool include:
- Safety comes first - pre-checks and potential failures are carefully handled.
- Your data is secure and fully encrypted.
- Ease-of-use with a live migration while your local cluster is still in use.
- Get access to what a cloud-based fully managed service has to offer: 
high availability and reliability, elastic scalability, and much more.

## Prerequisites 

Before getting started, make sure the following prerequisites are in place:

- Go to [Oasis Cloud](https://cloud.arangodb.com/home){:target="_blank"}
and sign in. If you donâ€™t have an account yet, sign-up to create one.

- Generate an Oasis API key and API secret. See a detailed guide on 
[how to create an API key](oasis/api-getting-started.html#creating-an-api-key).

### Setting up the target deployment in Oasis

Continue by [creating a new Oasis deployment](oasis/deployments.html#how-to-create-a-new-deployment)
or choose an existing one.

The target deployment in Oasis requires specific configuration rules to be
set up before the migration can start:

- **Configuration settings**: The target deployment must be compatible with the
source data cluster. This includes the ArangoDB version that is being used,
the DB-Servers count, and disk space.
- **Deployment region and cloud provider**: Choose the closest region to your
data cluster. This factor can speed up your migration to the cloud.

After setting up your Oasis deployment, wait for a few minutes to become 
fully operational.

## Running the migration tool

The `arangosync-migration` tool provides a set of commands that allow you to:
-  start the migration process
-  check whether your source and target clusters are fully compatible
-  get the current status of the migration process
-  stop or abort the migration process
-  switch the local cluster to read-only mode

### Starting the migration process

To start the migration process, run the following command:

```bash
arangosync-migration start
```

An optional `--check-only` option can be provided. When specified, you can check
if your local cluster and target deployment are compatible and if the migration 
can start. No data is sent to Oasis.

Before the actual migration starts, the `start` command also runs some
pre-checks. Among other things, it measures the disk space which is occupied
by your ArangoDB cluster. If you are using the same data volume for ArangoDB
servers and other data as well, the measurements can be incorrect.
Provide the `--source.ignore-metrics` option to overcome this.

Once the migration starts, the local cluster enters into monitoring mode and the
synchronization status is displayed in real-time. If you don't want to see the
status you can also terminate this process, as the underlying agent process
continues to work. If something goes wrong, restarting the same command restores
the replication state.

To restart the migration, use the `stop --abort` command.
Note that restarting works only if you are not using
auto-generated certificates.

{% hint 'warning' %}
Starting the migration creates a full copy of all data from the source cluster
to the target deployment in Oasis. All data that has previously existed in the
target deployment will be lost.
{% endhint %}

### During the migration...

What happens during active migration:
- The source data cluster remains usable. 
- The target deployment in Oasis is switched to read-only mode.
- Your root user password is not copied to the target deployment in Oasis.
To get your new root password, select the target deployment from the Oasis
Dashboard and go to the **Overview** tab. All other users are fully synchronized.

{% hint 'warning' %}
The migration tool increases the CPU and memory usage of the server you are
running on. Depending on your ArangoDB usage pattern, it may take a lot of CPU
to handle the replication. You can stop the migration process anytime
if you see any problems.
{% endhint %}

During active migration, the agent HTTPS server is executed on the `$MG_HOST:8629` 
endpoint. Make sure the host and port are available for the Oasis platform.
To change the default port, use the `--agent.master-port` option.

```bash
export MG_HOST=<your IP or publicly-available hostname here>
./arangosync-migration start \
  --source.cacert=tls-ca.crt \
  --source.keyfile=client-auth.keyfile \
  --source.endpoint=$COORDINATOR_ENDPOINT \
  --source.jwtSecret=clusterSecret \
  --oasis.api-key=$OASIS_API_KEY \
  --oasis.api-secret=$OASIS_API_SECRET \
  --oasis.deployment-id=$OASIS_DEPLOYMENT_ID \
  --agent.listen-host=$MG_HOST
```

### TLS server certificates

The migration agent HTTPS server uses TLS certificate pairs to ensure a secure
connection between your local cluster and the Oasis platform.
If you do not provide them, the migration tool creates self-signed certificates.
If you can provide TLS certificates, use the `arangodb` tool to convert them in
a suitable format for the migration tool.
See a detailed guide on how to [create a new certificate/keyfile pair](programs-starter-security.html).
Make sure to specify your publicly available host name, `$MG_HOST` when creating
the keyfile. 

When starting the migration, specify the generated files on the command line:

```bash
--agent.cacert=tls.crt --agent.keyfile=tls.keyfile --agent.client-auth-cacert=client-auth-ca.crt --agent.client-auth-keyfile=client-auth.keyfile
```

### How long does it take?

The total time required to complete the migration depends on how much data you
have and how many write operations are executed during the process.

You can also track the progress by checking the **Migration status** section of
your target deployment in Oasis.

### Getting the current status

To print the current status of the migration, run the following command:

```bash
arangosync-migration status
```

You can also add the `--watch` option to start monitoring the status in real-time.

### Stopping the migration process

To stop the migration, run the following command:

```bash
arangosync-migration stop
```

If replication is running normally, the command waits until all shards are
in sync. The local cluster is then switched into read-only mode.
After all shards are in-sync and the migration stopped, the target deployment
is switched into normal mode (read/write) while the source cluster stays in
read-only mode. 

```bash
./arangosync-migration stop \
  --oasis.api-key=$OASIS_API_KEY \
  --oasis.api-secret=$OASIS_API_SECRET \
  --oasis.deployment-id=$OASIS_DEPLOYMENT_ID
```

An optional `--abort` option is supported. If specified, the `stop` command 
will not check anymore if both deployments are in-sync and stops all
migration-related processes as soon as possible.

### Switching the local cluster to read-only mode

The following command allows switching [read-only mode](http/administration-and-monitoring.html#update-whether-or-not-a-server-is-in-read-only-mode)
for your local cluster on and off:

```bash
arangosync-migration set-server-mode
```

In a read-only mode, all write operations are going to fail with an error code
of 1004 (ERROR_READ_ONLY).
Creating or dropping databases and collections are also going to fail with 
error code 11 (ERROR_FORBIDDEN).

```bash
./arangosync-migration set-server-mode \
  --source.cacert=tls-ca.crt \
  --source.keyfile=client-auth.keyfile \
  --source.endpoint=$COORDINATOR_ENDPOINT \
  --source.jwtSecret=clusterSecret \
  --source.server-mode=readonly
```  
The `--source.server-mode` option allows you to specify the desired server mode.
Allowed values are `readonly` or `default`.

## Cloud migration workflow for minimal downtime

1. Download and start the `arangosync-migration` tool. The target deployment
is switched into read-only mode automatically.
2. Wait until all shards are in sync. You can use the `status` or the `start`
command with the same parameters to track that.
3. Optional: when all shards are in-sync, you can switch your applications
to use the Oasis deployment, but note that it stays into read-only mode
until the migration process is fully completed.
4. Stop the migration using the `stop` subcommand. What happens:
   - The source data cluster is switched into read-only mode.
   - It waits until all shards are synchronized.
   - The target deployment is switched into default read/write mode.

{% hint 'info' %}
    The source data cluster remains read-only. You can use the `set-server-mode` 
    subcommand to switch it back to default, if needed.
    In case something goes wrong during the migration, the `stop` command is not
    switching the source data cluster into read-only mode. 
{% endhint %}
