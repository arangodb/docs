# GraphML

{{ page.description }}
{:class="lead"}

Traditional machine learning overlooks the connections and relationships
between data points, which is where graph machine learning excels. However,
accessibility to GraphML has been limited to sizable enterprises equipped with
specialized teams of data scientists. ArangoGraphML, on the other hand,
simplifies the utilization of GraphML, enabling a broader range of personas
to extract profound insights from their data.

## How GraphML works

GraphML focuses on the utilization of neural networks specifically for
graph-related tasks. It is well-suited for addressing vague or fuzzy problems
and facilitating their resolution. The process involves incorporating both the
topology (node and edge structure) of a graph and the node and edge
characteristics and features to create a numerical representation known as an
embedding.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are designed specifically to learn meaningful
numerical representations, or embeddings, for nodes and edges in a graph.
By applying a series of steps, GNNs effectively create graph embeddings,
which are numerical representations that encode the essential information
about the nodes and edges in the graph. These embeddings can then be used for
various tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and graph-level
classification, where the model can make predictions based on the learned
patterns and relationships within the graph.
