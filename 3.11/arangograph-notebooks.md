{{ page.description }}

The ArangoGraph Notebook is a JupyterLab notebook embedded in the
[ArangoGraph Insights Platform](https://cloud.arangodb.com/){:target="_blank"}.
The notebook integrates seamlessly with the platform,
automatically connecting to ArangoGraph services, including ArangoDB and the
ArangoML platform services. This makes it much easier to leverage these
resources without having to download any data locally or to remember user IDs,
passwords, and endpoint URLs.
