{% hint 'tip' %}
ArangoGraph Notebooks don't include the ArangoGraphML services.
To enable the ArangoGraphML services, 
[get in touch](https://www.arangodb.com/contact/){:target="_blank"}
with the ArangoDB team.
{% endhint %}

The ArangoGraph Notebook is a JupyterLab notebook embedded in the
[ArangoGraph Insights Platform](https://cloud.arangodb.com/){:target="_blank"}.
The notebook integrates seamlessly with the platform,
automatically connecting to ArangoGraph services and ArangoDB.
This makes it much easier to leverage these resources without having
to download any data locally or to remember user IDs, passwords, and endpoint URLs.

For more information, see the [Notebooks](arangograph/notebooks.html) documentation.
