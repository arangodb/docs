Features and Improvements in ArangoDB 3.11
==========================================

The following list shows in detail which features have been added or improved in
ArangoDB 3.11. ArangoDB 3.11 also contains several bug fixes that are not listed
here.

AQL
---

### Added AQL functions

Added the `DATE_ISOWEEKYEAR()` function that returns the ISO week number,
like `DATE_ISOWEEK()` does, but also the year it belongs to:

```aql
RETURN DATE_ISOWEEKYEAR("2023-01-01") // { "week": 52, "year": 2022 }
```

See [AQL Date functions](aql/functions-date.html#date_isoweekyear) for details.

### Index cache refilling

The [edge cache refilling](release-notes-new-features310.html#edge-cache-refilling-experimental)
feature introduced in v3.9.6 and v3.10.2 is no longer experimental. From v3.11.0
onward, it is called _**index** cache refilling_ and not limited to edge caches
anymore, but also supports in-memory hash caches of persistent indexes
(persistent indexes with the `cacheEnabled` option set to `true`).

### Retry request for result batch

You can retry the request for the latest result batch of an AQL query cursor if
you enable the new `allowRetry` query option. See
[API Changes in ArangoDB 3.11](release-notes-api-changes311.html#cursor-api)
for details.

### `COLLECT ... INTO` can use `hash` method

Grouping with the `COLLECT` operation supports two different methods, `hash` and
`sorted`. For `COLLECT` operations with an `INTO` clause, only the `sorted` method
was previously supported, but the `hash` variant has been extended to now support
`INTO` clauses as well.

```aql
FOR i IN 1..10
  COLLECT v = i % 2 INTO group // OPTIONS { method: "hash" }
  SORT null
  RETURN { v, group }
```

```aql
Execution plan:
 Id   NodeType            Est.   Comment
  1   SingletonNode          1   * ROOT
  2   CalculationNode        1     - LET #3 = 1 .. 10   /* range */   /* simple expression */
  3   EnumerateListNode     10     - FOR i IN #3   /* list iteration */
  4   CalculationNode       10       - LET #5 = (i % 2)   /* simple expression */
  5   CollectNode            8       - COLLECT v = #5 INTO group KEEP i   /* hash */
  8   CalculationNode        8       - LET #9 = { "v" : v, "group" : group }   /* simple expression */
  9   ReturnNode             8       - RETURN #9
```

The query optimizer automatically chooses the `hash` method for the above
example query, but you can also specify your preferred method explicitly.

See the [`COLLECT` options](aql/operations-collect.html#method) for details.

Server options
--------------

### Verify `.sst` files

The new `--rocksdb.verify-sst` startup option lets you validate the `.sst` files
currently contained in the database directory on startup. If set to `true`,
on startup, all SST files in the `engine-rocksdb` folder in the database
directory are validated, then the process finishes execution.
The default value is `false`.

### Support for additional value suffixes

Numeric startup options support suffixes like `m` (megabytes) and `GiB` (gibibytes)
to make it easier to specify values that are expected in bytes. The following
suffixes are now also supported:

- `tib`, `TiB`, `TIB`: tebibytes (factor 1024<sup>4</sup>)
- `t`, `tb`, `T`, `TB`: terabytes (factor 1000<sup>4</sup>)
- `b`, `B`: bytes (factor 1)

Example: `arangod --rocksdb.total-write-buffer-size 2TiB`

See [Suffixes for numeric options](administration-configuration.html#suffixes-for-numeric-options)
for details.

### Disable user-defined AQL functions

The new `--javascript.user-defined-functions` startup option lets you disable
user-defined AQL functions so that no user-defined JavaScript code of
[UDFs](aql/extending.html) runs on the server. Also see
[Server security options](security-security-options.html).
