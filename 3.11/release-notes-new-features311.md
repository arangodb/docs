Features and Improvements in ArangoDB 3.11
==========================================

The following list shows in detail which features have been added or improved in
ArangoDB 3.11. ArangoDB 3.11 also contains several bug fixes that are not listed
here.

AQL
---

### Added AQL functions

Added the `DATE_ISOWEEKYEAR()` function that returns the ISO week number,
like `DATE_ISOWEEK()` does, but also the year it belongs to:

```aql
RETURN DATE_ISOWEEKYEAR("2023-01-01") // { "week": 52, "year": 2022 }
```

See [AQL Date functions](aql/functions-date.html#date_isoweekyear) for details.

### Index cache refilling

The [edge cache refilling](release-notes-new-features310.html#edge-cache-refilling-experimental)
feature introduced in v3.9.6 and v3.10.2 is no longer experimental. From v3.11.0
onward, it is called _**index** cache refilling_ and not limited to edge caches
anymore, but also supports in-memory hash caches of persistent indexes
(persistent indexes with the `cacheEnabled` option set to `true`).

### Retry request for result batch

You can retry the request for the latest result batch of an AQL query cursor if
you enable the new `allowRetry` query option. See
[API Changes in ArangoDB 3.11](release-notes-api-changes311.html#cursor-api)
for details.

### `COLLECT ... INTO` can use `hash` method

Grouping with the `COLLECT` operation supports two different methods, `hash` and
`sorted`. For `COLLECT` operations with an `INTO` clause, only the `sorted` method
was previously supported, but the `hash` variant has been extended to now support
`INTO` clauses as well.

```aql
FOR i IN 1..10
  COLLECT v = i % 2 INTO group // OPTIONS { method: "hash" }
  SORT null
  RETURN { v, group }
```

```aql
Execution plan:
 Id   NodeType            Est.   Comment
  1   SingletonNode          1   * ROOT
  2   CalculationNode        1     - LET #3 = 1 .. 10   /* range */   /* simple expression */
  3   EnumerateListNode     10     - FOR i IN #3   /* list iteration */
  4   CalculationNode       10       - LET #5 = (i % 2)   /* simple expression */
  5   CollectNode            8       - COLLECT v = #5 INTO group KEEP i   /* hash */
  8   CalculationNode        8       - LET #9 = { "v" : v, "group" : group }   /* simple expression */
  9   ReturnNode             8       - RETURN #9
```

The query optimizer automatically chooses the `hash` method for the above
example query, but you can also specify your preferred method explicitly.

See the [`COLLECT` options](aql/operations-collect.html#method) for details.

Server options
--------------

### Verify `.sst` files

The new `--rocksdb.verify-sst` startup option lets you validate the `.sst` files
currently contained in the database directory on startup. If set to `true`,
on startup, all SST files in the `engine-rocksdb` folder in the database
directory are validated, then the process finishes execution.
The default value is `false`.

### Support for additional value suffixes

Numeric startup options support suffixes like `m` (megabytes) and `GiB` (gibibytes)
to make it easier to specify values that are expected in bytes. The following
suffixes are now also supported:

- `tib`, `TiB`, `TIB`: tebibytes (factor 1024<sup>4</sup>)
- `t`, `tb`, `T`, `TB`: terabytes (factor 1000<sup>4</sup>)
- `b`, `B`: bytes (factor 1)

Example: `arangod --rocksdb.total-write-buffer-size 2TiB`

See [Suffixes for numeric options](administration-configuration.html#suffixes-for-numeric-options)
for details.

### Disable user-defined AQL functions

The new `--javascript.user-defined-functions` startup option lets you disable
user-defined AQL functions so that no user-defined JavaScript code of
[UDFs](aql/extending.html) runs on the server. Also see
[Server security options](security-security-options.html).

### Configurable status code if write concern not fulfilled

In cluster deployments, you can use a replication factor greater than `1` for
collections. This creates additional shard replicas for redundancy. For write
operations to these collections, you can define how many replicas need to
acknowledge the write for the operation to succeed. This option is called the
write concern. If there are not enough in-sync replicas available, the
write concern cannot be fulfilled. An error with the HTTP `403 Forbidden`
status code is returned immediately in this case.

You can now change the status code via the new
`--cluster.failed-write-concern-status-code` startup option. It defaults to `403`
but you can set it to `503` to use an HTTP `503 Service Unavailable` status code
instead. This better signals client applications that it is a temporary error.

Note that no automatic retry of the operation is attempted by the cluster if you
set the startup option to `503`. It only changes the status code to one that
doesn't signal a permanent error like `403` does.
It is up to client applications to retry the operation.
