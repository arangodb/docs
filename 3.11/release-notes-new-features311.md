Features and Improvements in ArangoDB 3.11
==========================================

The following list shows in detail which features have been added or improved in
ArangoDB 3.11. ArangoDB 3.11 also contains several bug fixes that are not listed
here.

AQL
---

### Added AQL functions

Added the `DATE_ISOWEEKYEAR()` function that returns the ISO week number,
like `DATE_ISOWEEK()` does, but also the year it belongs to:

```aql
RETURN DATE_ISOWEEKYEAR("2023-01-01") // { "week": 52, "year": 2022 }
```

See [AQL Date functions](aql/functions-date.html#date_isoweekyear) for details.

### Index cache refilling

The [edge cache refilling](release-notes-new-features310.html#edge-cache-refilling-experimental)
feature introduced in v3.9.6 and v3.10.2 is no longer experimental. From v3.11.0
onward, it is called _**index** cache refilling_ and not limited to edge caches
anymore, but also supports in-memory hash caches of persistent indexes
(persistent indexes with the `cacheEnabled` option set to `true`).

Server options
--------------

### Verify `.sst` files

The new `--rocksdb.verify-sst` startup option lets you validate the `.sst` files
currently contained in the database directory on startup. If set to `true`,
on startup, all SST files in the `engine-rocksdb` folder in the database
directory are validated, then the process finishes execution.
The default value is `false`.

### Support for terabyte and tebibyte suffixes

Numeric startup options support suffixes like `m` (megabytes) and `GiB` (gibibytes)
to make it easier to specify values that are expected in bytes. The following
suffixes are now also supported:

- `tib`, `TiB`, `TIB`: tebibytes (factor 1024<sup>4</sup>)
- `t`, `tb`, `T`, `TB`: terabytes (factor 1000<sup>4</sup>)

Example: `arangod --rocksdb.total-write-buffer-size 2TiB`

See [Suffixes for numeric options](administration-configuration.html#suffixes-for-numeric-options)
for details.


Cursor API
----------

### Retry request for last batch

The cursor API can now receive a retry request to retrieve the response for the
latest batch. The response object for `_api/_cursor/<cursorId>` now contains a 
sub-attribute `nextBatchId` which is the id of the next batch that will be 
fetched when the cursor advances, after executing the current request. Then, on 
the next run of `_api/_cursor/<cursorId>`, which should output the response object 
of the batch with `nextBatchId`, if it's unsuccessful because of some connection 
issue, the user can retry to get the response object for that batch with a POST 
request to `_api/<cursorId>/<nextBatchId>`. This request does not advance the 
cursor, and only the latest batch fetched would be cached, meaning requests to 
retrieve the response for a former already fetched batch would return an error.
