# Incompatible changes in ArangoDB 3.11

It is recommended to check the following list of incompatible changes **before**
upgrading to ArangoDB 3.11, and adjust any client programs if necessary.

The following incompatible changes have been made in ArangoDB 3.11:

## Restriction of indexable fields

It is now forbidden to create indexes that cover fields whose attribute names
start or end with `:` , for example, `fields: ["value:"]`. This notation is
reserved for internal use.

Existing indexes are not affected but you cannot create new indexes with a
preceding or trailing colon.

## Startup options

### `--agency.pool-size` deprecated

The `--agency.pool-size` option was effectively not properly supported in any
version of ArangoDB. Setting the option to anything but the value of
`--agency.size` should be avoided.

From v3.11.0 onwards, this option is deprecated, and setting it to a value
different than the value of `--agency.size` leads to a startup error.

## Client tools

### arangoexport

The default output file type produced by arangoexport, controlled by the `--type`
startup option, has been changed from `json` to `jsonl`.
This allows for more efficient processing of the files produced by arangoexport
with other tools, such as arangoimport, by default.
