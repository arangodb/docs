API Changes in ArangoDB 3.11
============================

This document summarizes the HTTP API changes and other API changes in ArangoDB 3.11.
The target audience for this document are developers who maintain drivers and
integrations for ArangoDB 3.11.

## HTTP RESTful API

### Behavior changes



### Privilege changes



### Endpoint return value changes



### Endpoints added



### Endpoints augmented

#### Cursor API

The cursor API can now return an additional statistics value in its `stats` subattribute:

- **intermediateCommits**: the total number of intermediate commits the query has performed. 
  This number can only be greater than zero for data-modification queries that perform modifications 
  beyond the `--rocksdb.intermediate-commit-count` or `--rocksdb.intermediate-commit-size` thresholds.
  In a cluster, the intermediate commits are tracked per DB server that participates in the query
  and are summed up in the end.

#### Restriction of indexable fields

It is now forbidden to create indexes that cover fields whose attribute names
start or end with `:` , for example, `fields: ["value:"]`. This notation is
reserved for internal use.

Existing indexes are not affected but you cannot create new indexes with a
preceding or trailing colon using the `POST /_api/index` endpoint.

### Endpoints moved



### Endpoints deprecated



### Endpoints removed
