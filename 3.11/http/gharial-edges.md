Handling Edges
==============

Examples will explain the REST API for [manipulating edges](../graphs-general-graphs-functions.html)
of the [graph module](../graphs.html)
on the [knows graph](../graphs.html#the-knows_graph):

![Social Example Graph](../images/knows_graph.png)
{% docublock post_api_gharial_graph_edge_collection %}
{% docublock get_api_gharial_graph_edge_collection_edge %}

Examples will explain the API on the [social graph](../graphs.html#the-social-graph):

![Social Example Graph](../images/social_graph.png)
{% docublock patch_api_gharial_graph_edge_collection_edge %}
{% docublock put_api_gharial_graph_edge_collection_edge %}
{% docublock delete_api_gharial_graph_edge_collection_edge %}
