Introduction

of hot backups, specifically regarding storage engine, deployment, scope
and storage space.

Creation
--------

The process of creating hot backups is ideally an instantaneous event during
normal operations, that consists of a few subsequent steps behind the scenes:

- Stop all write access to the entire installation using a global transaction lock
- Create a new local directory under `<data-dir>/backups/<timestamp>_<backup-label>`
- Create hard links to the active database files in `<data-dir>` in the newly
  created backup directory
- Release the global transaction lock to resume normal operation
- Report success of the operation

The above quite precisely describes the tasks in a single instance installation
and could technically finish in under a millisecond. The unknown factor above is
of course, when the hot backup process is able to obtain the global transaction lock.

When considering the ArangoDB cluster two more steps need to integrate while
others just become slightly more exciting. On the coordinator tasked with the
hot backup do as follows:

- Using the agency, make sure that no two hot backups collide
- Obtain a dump of the Agency's `Plan` key
- Stop all write access to the **entire cluster** installation using a
  global transaction lock
- If lock could not be obtained during subsequently growing periods
- **On each database server** create a new local directory under
  `<data-dir>/backups/<timestamp>_<backup-label>`
- **On each database server** create hard links to the active database files
  in `<data-dir>` in the newly created backup directory
- **On each database server** store a redundant copy of the above agency dump
- Release the global transaction lock to resume normal operation
- Report success of the operation

Again under good conditions, a complete hot backup could be obtained from a
cluster with many database servers within a very short time in the range
of that of the single server installation.

### Global Transaction Lock

The global transaction lock mentioned above is such a determining factor,
that it needs a little detailed attention. 

It is obvious that in order to be able to create a consistent snapshot of the
ArangoDB world on a specific single server or cluster deployment, one must
stop all transactional write operations at the next time possible or else
consistency would no longer be given.

On the other hand it is also obvious, that there is no way for ArangoDB to
known, when that time will come. It might be there with the next attempt a
nanosecond away, but it could of course not come for the next 2 minutes.

ArangoDB tries to obtain that lock over and over again. On the single server
instances these consecutive tries will not be noticeable. At some point the
lock is obtained and the backup is created then within no time.

In clusters things are a little more complicated and noticeable.
A coordinator, which is trying to obtain the global lock must try to get locks
on all _DBServers_ simultaneously; potentially succeeding on some and not
succeeding on others, leading to apparent dead times in the cluster's operation.

This process can happen multiple times until success is achieved.
One has control over the length of the period during which the lock is tried to
be obtained each time prolonging the last wait time by 10%.

### Agency Lock

Less of a variable, however equally important is to obtain a freeze on the
cluster's structure itself. This is done through the creation of a simple key
lock in the cluster's configuration to stop all ongoing background tasks,
which are there to handle fail overs, shard movings, server removals etc.
Its role is also to prevent multiple simultaneous hot backup operations.
The acquisition of this key is predictably done within a matter of few seconds.

### Operation's Time Scope

One the global transaction lock is obtained, everything goes very quickly.
A new backup directory is created, the write ahead lock is flushed and
hard links are made on file system level to all persistence files.
The duration is not affected by the amount of data in ArangoDB and is near
instantaneous.

### Point in Time Recovery

One of the great advantages of the method is the consistent snapshot nature.
It gives the operator of the database the ability to persist a true and
complete time freeze at near zero impact on the ongoing operation.
The recovery is easy and restores the entire ArangoDB installation to a
desired snapshot.

Apart from the ability of creating such snapshots it offers a great and easy
to use opportunity to experiment with ArangoDB with firewalls to protect
against data loss or corruption.

### Remote Upload and Download

As an Enterprise Edition feature, we have fully integrated the
[Rclone](https://rclone.org/) sync for cloud storage. Rclone is a very
versatile inter site sync facility, which opens up a vast field of transport
protocols and remote syncing APIs from Amazon's S3 over Dropbox, WebDAV,
all the way to the local file system and network storage.

One can use the upload and download functionalities to migrate entire cluster
installations in this way, copy cluster and single server snapshots all
over the world, create an intuitive and easy to use quick access safety
backbone of the data operation. 

Rclone is open source and available under the MIT license, is battle tested
and has garnered close to 15k stars on GitHub professing to the confidence
of lots of users.
