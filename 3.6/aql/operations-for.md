FOR
===

The versatile `FOR` keyword can be used to iterate over a collection or View,
all elements of an array or to traverse a graph.

## General Syntax

```js
FOR variableName IN expression
```

There is also a special variant for [graph traversals](graphs-traversals.html):

```js
FOR vertexVariableName, edgeVariableName, pathVariableName IN traversalExpression
```

For Views, there is a special (optional) [`SEARCH` keyword](operations-search.html):

```js
FOR variableName IN viewName SEARCH searchExpression
```

Note that Views cannot be used as edge collections in traversals:

```js
FOR v IN 1..3 ANY startVertex viewName /* invalid! */
```

Each array element returned by *expression* is visited exactly once. It is
required that *expression* returns an array in all cases. The empty array is
allowed, too. The current array element is made available for further processing 
in the variable specified by *variableName*.

```js
FOR u IN users
  RETURN u
```

This will iterate over all elements from the array *users* (note: this array
consists of all documents from the collection named "users" in this case) and
make the current array element available in variable *u*. *u* is not modified in
this example but simply pushed into the result using the `RETURN` keyword.

Note: When iterating over collection-based arrays as shown here, the order of
documents is undefined unless an explicit sort order is defined using a `SORT`
statement.

The variable introduced by `FOR` is available until the scope the `FOR` is
placed in is closed.

Another example that uses a statically declared array of values to iterate over:

```js
FOR year IN [ 2011, 2012, 2013 ]
  RETURN { "year" : year, "isLeapYear" : year % 4 == 0 && (year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0) }
```

Nesting of multiple `FOR` statements is allowed, too. When `FOR` statements are
nested, a cross product of the array elements returned by the individual `FOR`
statements will be created.

```js
FOR u IN users
  FOR l IN locations
    RETURN { "user" : u, "location" : l }
```

In this example, there are two array iterations: an outer iteration over the array
*users* plus an inner iteration over the array *locations*. The inner array is
traversed as many times as there are elements in the outer array.  For each
iteration, the current values of *users* and *locations* are made available for
further processing in the variable *u* and *l*.

## Options

For collections and views, the `FOR` construct supports an optional `OPTIONS`
suffix to modify behavior. The general syntax is:

```js
FOR variableName IN expression OPTIONS {option: value, ...}
```

### `indexHint`

For collections, index hints can be given to the optimizer with the `indexHint`
option. The value can be a single **index name** or a list of index names in
order of preference:

```js
FOR … IN … OPTIONS { indexHint: "byName" }
```

```js
FOR … IN … OPTIONS { indexHint: ["byName", "byColor"] }
```

Whenever there is a chance to potentially use an index for this `FOR` loop,
the optimizer will first check if the specified index can be used. In case of
an array of indices, the optimizer will check the feasibility of each index in
the specified order. It will use the first suitable index, regardless of
whether it would normally use a different index.

If none of the specified indices is suitable, then it falls back to its normal
logic to select another index or fails if `forceForceHint` is enabled.

### `forceIndexHint`

Index hints are not enforced by default. If `forceIndexHint` is set to `true`,
then an error is generated if `indexHint` does not contain a usable index,
instead of using a fallback index or not using an index at all.

```js
FOR … IN … OPTIONS { indexHint: … , forceIndexHint: true }
```
