# Projects

Below organizations in the Oasis deployment hierarchy are projects. They can
represent organizational units such as teams, product groups, environments
(e.g. staging vs. production). You can have any number of projects under one
organization.

**Organizations → <u>Projects</u> → Deployments**

Projects are a container for related deployments, certificates & IP allowlists.
Projects also come with their own policy for access control. You can have any
number of deployment under one project.

In essence, you can create whatever structure fits you for a given organization,
its projects and deployments.

## How to manage IP allowlists

IP allowlists let you limit access to your deployment to certain IP ranges.
It is optional, but strongly recommended to do so.

You can create an allowlist as part of 

1. Click on a project name in the _Projects_ section of the main navigation.
2. Click on the _Security_ tab.

   - The _trash can_ icon to delete the allowlist.

## How to manage certificates

Certificates are utilized for encrypted remote administration.

Certificates that do have the _Use well known certificate_ option enabled do
not need any installation and will be supported by almost all web-browsers
automatically.

Each certificate you create in ArangoDB Oasis that has the
_Use well known certificate_ option disabled, you will also need to install on
your local machine. This operation will slightly vary between operating systems.

1. Click on a project name in the _Projects_ section of the main navigation.
2. Click on the _Security_ tab.
3. In the _Certificates_ section, click on:
   - The _New certificate_ button to create a new certificate.
   - A name or the _eye_ icon in the _Actions_ column to view a certificate.
     The dialog that opens provides commands for installing and uninstalling
     the certificate through a console.
   - The _pencil_ icon to edit a certificate.
     You can also view a certificate and click on the _Edit_ button.
   - The _tag_ icon to make the certificate the new default.
   - The _trash can_ icon to delete a certificate.
