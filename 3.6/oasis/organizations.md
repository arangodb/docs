# Organizations

At the highest level of the Oasis deployment hierarchy are organizations.
Organizations are a container for projects.

**<u>Organizations</u> → Projects → Deployments**

An organization typically represents a (commercial) entity such as a company,
company division, institution or non-profit organization.

Users can be members of one or more organizations. However, you can only be a
member of one _Free to try_ tier organization at a time.

## How to switch between my organizations

1. The first entry in the main navigation (with a double arrow icon) indicates
   the current organization.
2. Click on it to bring up a dropdown menu to select another organization your
   are a member of.
3. The overview will open for the selected organization, showing the number of
   projects, the tier and when it was created.

## How to upgrade to professional

ArangoDB Oasis comes with a free-to-try plan that lets you test our ArangoDB
Cloud for free for 14 days. After the trial period, your deployments will
automatically be deleted.

You can convert to the professional service model at any time by adding
your billing details and at least one payment method. You can then create
additional organizations and projects and have more and larger deployments.
