# Oasis API

[ArangoDB Oasis](https://cloud.arangodb.com/){:target="_blank"}, the
ArangoDB Cloud, comes with its own API. This API enables you to control all
resources inside Oasis in a scriptable manor. Typical use cases are spinning
up Oasis deployments during continuous integration and infrastructure as code.

The ArangoDB Oasis APIâ€¦

- is a well specified API that uses
  [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/){:target="_blank"}
  as interface definition and [gRPC](https://grpc.io/){:target="_blank"} as
  underlying protocol.

- allows for automatic generation of clients for a large list of languages.
  A Go client is available out of the box.

- uses API keys for authentication. API keys impersonate a user and inherit
  the permissions of that user.

- is also available as a commandline tool called [oasisctl](oasisctl.html).

- is also available as a
  [Terraform plugin](https://github.com/arangodb-managed/terraform-provider-oasis/){:target="_blank"}.
  This plugin makes integration of Oasis in infrastructure as code projects
  very simple. Note that the terraform plugin is still in **prerelease**, so
  its interface can still change.
