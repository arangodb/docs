[ArangoDB Oasis](https://cloud.arangodb.com/){:target="_blank"},
the ArangoDB Cloud comes with its own API.
This API enables you to control all resources inside 
Oasis in a scriptable manor.
Typical use cases are spinning up Oasis deployments during continous integration and infrastructure as code.

The ArangoDB Oasis API...

- is a well specified API that uses protocol buffers as interface definition and GRPC as underlying protocol.

- clients can be generated automatically for a large list of languages. A Go client is available out of the box.

- uses API keys for authentication. API keys impersonate a user and inherit the permissions of that user.

- is also available as a commandline tool called [oasisctl](https://github.com/arangodb-managed/oasisctl/){:target="_blank"}. This tool makes integration of Oasis in all kinds of (bash) scripts easy. Oasisctl is available for Linux, Windows & Mac. Oasisctl is also a good example on how to use the API.

- is also available as a [Terraform plugin](https://github.com/arangodb-managed/terraform-provider-oasis/){:target="_blank"}. This plugin makes integration of Oasis in infrastructure as code projects very simple. Note that the terraform plugin is still in **prerelease**, so its interface can still change.
