# Users and Groups

## Users, groups & members

When you use Oasis, you are logged in as a user.
A user has properties such as name & email address.
Most important of the user is that it serves as an identity of a person.

A user is member of one or more organizations in Oasis.
You can become a member of an organization in the following ways:

- Create a new organization. You will become the first member and owner of that
  organization.
- Be invited to join an organization. Once accepted (by the invited user), this
  user becomes a member of the organization.

If the number of members of an organization becomes large, it helps to group
users. In Oasis a group is part of an organization and a group contains
a list of users. All users of the group must be member of the owning organization.



In the **People** section of the dashboard you can manage users, groups and
invites for the organization.

To edit permissions of members see [Access Control](access-control.html).

## Members

Members are a list of users that can access an organization.
