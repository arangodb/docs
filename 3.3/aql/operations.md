* [FILTER](operations-filter.html): Restrict the results to elements that match arbitrary logical conditions.
* [SORT](operations-sort.html): Force a sort of the array of already produced intermediate results.
* [LIMIT](operations-limit.html): Reduce the number of elements in the result to at most the specified number, optionally skip elements (pagination).
* [LET](operations-let.html): Assign an arbitrary value to a variable.
* [COLLECT](operations-collect.html): Group an array by one or multiple group criteria. Can also count and aggregate.
* [REMOVE](operations-remove.html): Remove documents from a collection.
* [UPDATE](operations-update.html): Partially update documents in a collection.
* [REPLACE](operations-replace.html): Completely replace documents in a collection.
* [INSERT](operations-insert.html): Insert new documents into a collection.
* [UPSERT](operations-upsert.html): Update/replace an existing document, or create it in the case it does not exist.
* [WITH](operations-with.html): Specify collections used in a query (at query begin only).
* [WINDOW](operations-window.html): Perform aggregations over related rows.
