API Changes in ArangoDB 3.9
===========================

This document summarizes the HTTP API changes and other API changes in ArangoDB 3.9.
The target audience for this document are developers who maintain drivers and
integrations for ArangoDB 3.9.

## HTTP RESTful API

### Privilege changes

### Endpoint return value changes

### Endpoints added

### Endpoints augmented

### Endpoints moved

### Endpoints removed

The REST API endpoint `/_api/export` has been removed in ArangoDB 3.9.
This endpoint was previously only present in single server, but never
supported in cluster deployments.

The purpose of the endpoint was to provide the full data of a collection
without holding collection locks for a long time, which was useful for
the MMFile storage engine with its collection-level locks.

The MMFiles engine is gone since ArangoDB 3.7, and the only remaining
storage engine since then is RocksDB. For the RocksDB engine, the
`/_api/export` endpoint internally used a streaming AQL query such as

```js
FOR doc IN @@collection RETURN doc
```

anyway. To remove API redundancy, the API endpoint has been deprecated
in ArangoDB 3.8 and is now removed. If the functionality is still required
by client applications, running a streaming AQL query can be used as a
substitution.
