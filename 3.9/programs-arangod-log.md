# ArangoDB Server Log Options

## Log levels and topics

ArangoDB's log output is grouped into topics. `--log.level` can be specified
multiple times at startup, for as many topics as needed. The log verbosity and
output files can be adjusted per log topic. For example

```
--log.level startup=trace --log.level queries=trace --log.level info
```

will log messages concerning startup at trace level, AQL queries at trace level
and everything else at info level.

In a configuration file, it is written like this:

```
[log]
level = startup=trace
level = queries=trace
level = info
```

The available log levels are:

- `fatal`: only logs fatal errors
- `error`: only logs errors
- `warning`: only logs warnings and errors
- `info`: logs information messages, warnings and errors
- `debug`: logs debug and information messages, warnings and errors
- `trace`: logs trace, debug and information messages, warnings and errors

Note that levels `debug` and `trace` will be very verbose.

See [Log Levels](monitoring-log-levels.html) in the Monitoring chapter for a
detailed description of the different levels.

Some relevant log topics available in ArangoDB 3 are:

- `agency`: information about the Agency
- `collector`: information about the WAL collector's state
- `compactor`: information about the collection datafile compactor
- `datafiles`: datafile-related operations
- `mmap`: information about memory-mapping operations (including msync)
- `performance`: performance-related messages
- `queries`: executed AQL queries, slow queries
- `replication`: replication-related info
- `requests`: HTTP requests
- `startup`: information about server startup and shutdown
- `threads`: information about threads

See more [log levels](http/administration-and-monitoring.html#modify-and-return-the-current-server-log-level)

## Log outputs

The log option `--log.output <definition>` allows directing the global
or per-topic log output to different outputs. The output definition `<definition>`
can be one of

- `-` for stdin
- `+` for stderr
- `syslog://<syslog-facility>`
- `syslog://<syslog-facility>/<application-name>`
- `file://<relative-path>`

The option can be specified multiple times in order to configure the output
for different log topics. To set up a per-topic output configuration, use
`--log.output <topic>=<definition>`, e.g.

    queries=file://queries.txt

logs all queries to the file "queries.txt".

Any occurrence of `$PID` inside a log output value will be replaced at runtime 
with the actual process id. This enables logging to process-specific files, e.g.

`--log.output 'file:///var/log/arangod.log.$PID'`

Please note that the dollar sign may need extra escaping when specified from 
inside shells such as Bash.

The old option `--log.file` is still available in 3.0 for convenience reasons. In
3.0 it is a shortcut for the more general option `--log.output file://filename`.

The old option `--log.requests-file` is still available in 3.0. It is now a shortcut
for the more general option `--log.output requests=file://...`.

Using `--log.output` also allows directing log output to different files based on 
topics. For example, to log all AQL queries to a file "queries.log" one can use the 
options:

```
--log.level queries=trace --log.output queries=file:///path/to/queries.log
```

To additionally log HTTP request to a file named "requests.log" add the options:

```
--log.level requests=info --log.output requests=file:///path/to/requests.log
```

If you specify `--log.file-mode octalvalue` then any newly created log
file will use "octalvalue" as file mode. Please note that the `umask`
value will be applied as well.

If you specify `--log.file-group name` then any newly created log file
will try to use "name" as group name. Please note that you have to be
a member of that group. Otherwise the group ownership will not be
changed. Please note that this option is only available under Linux
and Mac. It is not available under Windows.

## Forcing direct output

The option `--log.force-direct` can be used to disable logging in an extra
logging thread. If set to `true`, any log messages are immediately printed in the
thread that triggered the log message. This is non-optimal for performance but
can aid debugging. If set to `false`, log messages are handed off to an extra
logging thread, which asynchronously writes the log messages.

## Time format

The option `--log.time-format` controls the time format used in log output.
The possible values for this option are:

Format                  | Example                  | Description
:-----------------------|:------------------------ |:-----------
`timestamp`             | 1553766923000            | unix timestamps, in seconds
`timestamp-millis`      | 1553766923000.123        | unix timestamps, in seconds, with millisecond precision
`timestamp-micros`      | 1553766923000.123456     | unix timestamps, in seconds, with microsecond precision
`uptime`                | 987654                   | seconds since server start
`uptime-millis`         | 987654.123               | seconds since server start, with millisecond precision
`uptime-micros`         | 987654.123456            | seconds since server start, with microsecond precision
`utc-datestring`        | 2019-03-28T09:55:23Z     | UTC-based date and time in format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ 
`utc-datestring-millis` | 2019-03-28T09:55:23.123Z | like `utc-datestring`, but with millisecond precision
`local-datestring`      | 2019-03-28T10:55:23      | local date and time in format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS

## Escaping

There are two flags for retaining or escaping control and unicode 
characters in the log. The flag `--log.escape` is deprecated since v3.9.0, and instead, 
the new flags `--log.escape-control-chars` and `log.escape-unicode-chars` 
should be used. 

- `--log.escape-control-chars`: this flag applies to the control characters, which have hex codes below `\x20`, 
  and also the character DEL with hex code `\x7f`. When the flag value is set to `false`, control 
characters will be retained when they have a visible representation, and replaced
with a space character in case they don't have a visible representation. For example, 
the control characer `\n` is visible, so a `\n` will be displayed in the log. Contrary, 
the control character `BEL` is not visible, so a space will be displayed instead.
When the flag value is set to `true`, the hex code for the character is displayed, for 
example, the `BEL` character will be displayed as its hex code, `\x07`.
The default value for this flag is `true` to ensure compatibility with 
previous versions.

- `--log.escape-unicode-chars`: when its value is set to false, the unicode character
will be retained, and its actual value will be displayed. For example, `犬` will 
be displayed as `犬`. When its value is set to true, the character is escaped, and 
the hex code for the character is displayed. For example, `犬` would be displayed 
as its hex code, `\u72AC`. 
	The default value for this flag is set to `false` for compatibility with 
previous versions.

A side effect of turning off the escaping is that it will reduce the CPU 
overhead for the logging. However, this will only be noticeable when logging
is set to a very verbose level (e.g. debug or trace).

## Maximum line length

<small>Introduced in: v3.7.9</small>

`--log.max-entry-length value`

This option can be used to limit the maximum line length for individual log
messages that are written into normal logfiles by arangod.

{% hint 'info' %}
This option does not include audit log messages. See
[--audit.max-entry-length](programs-arangod-audit.html#maximum-line-length)
instead.
{% endhint %}

Any log messages longer than the specified value will be truncated and the
suffix `...` will be added to them.

The purpose of this parameter is to shorten long log messages in case there is
lot a lot of space for logfiles, and to keep rogue log messages from overusing
resources.

The default value is 128 MB, which is very high and should effectively mean
downwards-compatibility with previous arangod versions, which did not restrict
the maximum size of log messages.

## Color logging

`--log.color value`

Logging to terminal output is by default colored. Colorful logging can be 
turned off by setting the value to false.

## Source function, file and line number

`--log.line-number`

If enabled, then log messages will include the function name, file name and
line number of the source code that issued the log message. The format is
`func@FileName.cpp:123`.

Example:

```

```

## Prefix

Log prefix: `--log.prefix`

This option specifies a prefix for log messages.

Example: `arangod ... --log.prefix "-->"`

```
2020-07-23T09:46:03Z --> [17493] INFO ...
```

## Process ID, Thread ID and Name

Log Process identifier: `--log.process` (introduced in 3.8.0)

Log thread identifier: `--log.thread`

Log thread name: `--log.thread-name`

When log output is generated, the process ID is emitted as part of the log
information by default. This can be turned off by adjusting the `--log.process`
option.

The thread ID is not emitted by default, but it can be enabled by setting the
option `--log.thread`.

To also log thread names, it is possible to set the `--log.thread-name`
option. By default `--log.thread-name` is set to `false`.

Here is an example that only contains the process ID (19355 in this case):

```
2010-09-20T13:04:01Z [19355] ... ready for business
```

And here is an example that also contains the thread ID in addition:

```
2010-09-20T13:04:17Z [19371-18446744072487317056] ... ready for business
```

And another example with process and thread identifier logging disabled,
but thread name logging turned on:

```
2010-09-20T13:04:29Z [main] ... ready for business
```

## IDs

Log IDs: `--log.ids true`

Since ArangoDB 3.5, each log invocation in the ArangoDB source code contains
a unique log ID, which can be used to quickly find the location in the source
code that produced a specific log message. These log IDs are shown by
default, unless the option `--log.ids` is set to `false`.

Log IDs are printed as 5-digit hexadecimal identifiers in square brackets
between the log level and the log topic, e.g.

```
2020-06-22T21:16:48Z [39028] INFO [144fe] {general} using storage engine 'rocksdb'
```
(where `144fe` is the log ID).

## Role

Log role: `--log.role`

When set to `true`, this option will make the ArangoDB logger print a single
character with the server's role into each logged message. The roles are:

- U: Undefined / unclear (used at startup)
- S: Single server
- C: Coordinator
- P: Primary / DB-Server
- A: Agent

The default value for this option is `false`, so no roles will be logged.

## Hostname

Log hostname: `--log.hostname`

This option specifies an optional hostname to be logged at the beginning of
each log message (for regular logging) or inside the `hostname` attribute
(for JSON-based logging).

The default value is the empty string, meaning no hostnames will be logged.
Setting this option to a value of `auto` will automatically determine the
hostname and use that value.

Example: `arangod ... --log.hostname "auto"`

## JSON log output

<small>Introduced in: v3.8.0</small>

Toggle JSON log output: `--log.use-json-format`

This option can be used to switch log output to JSON format.
Each log message then produces a separate line with JSON-encoded log data,
which can be consumed by applications.

The attributes produced for each log message JSON object are:

| Key        | Value      |
|:-----------|:-----------|
| `time`     | date/time of log message, in format specified by `--log.time-format`
| `prefix`   | only emitted if `--log.prefix` is set
| `pid`      | process id, only emitted if `--log.process` is set
| `tid`      | thread id, only emitted if `--log.thread` is set
| `thread`   | thread name, only emitted if `--log.thread-name` is set
| `role`     | server role (1 character), only emitted if `--log.role` is set
| `level`    | log level (e.g. `"WARN"`, `"INFO"`)
| `file`     | source file name of log message, only emitted if `--log.line-number` is set
| `line`     | source file line of log message, only emitted if `--log.line-number` is set 
| `function` | source file function name, only emitted if `--log.line-number` is set
| `topic`    | log topic name
| `id`       | log id (5 digit hexadecimal string), only emitted if `--log.ids` is set
| `hostname` | hostname if `--log.hostname` is set
| `message`  | the actual log message payload

### Log API Access

<small>Introduced in: v3.4.11, v3.5.6, v3.6.5, v3.7.1</small>

`/_admin/log` control: `--log.api-enabled`

Credentials data is not written to log files. Nevertheless, some logged
data might be sensitive depending on the context of the deployment. For
example, if request logging is switched on, user requests and
corresponding data might end up in log files.
Therefore, a certain care with log files is recommended.

Since the database server offers an API to control logging and query
logging data, this API has to be secured properly. By default, the API
is accessible for admin users (administrative access to the `_system`
database). However, one can lock this down further.

The possible values for this option are:

 - `true`: The API `/_admin/log` is accessible for admin users.
 - `jwt`: The API `/_admin/log` is accessible only for the superuser
   (authentication with JWT token and empty username).
 - `false`: The API `/_admin/log` is not accessible at all.

The default value is `true`.

## Logging to memory buffers

<small>Introduced in: v3.8.0</small>

Log to memory: `--log.in-memory`

This option can be used to toggle storing log messages in memory, from which
they can be consumed via the `/_admin/log` HTTP API and via the Web UI.
By default, this option is turned on, so log messages are consumable via the
API and UI. Turning this option off will disable that functionality, save a
tiny bit of memory for the in-memory log buffers and prevent potential log
information leakage via these means.

Log level control for in-memory log messages: `--log.in-memory-level`

This option can be used to control which log messages are preserved in memory 
(in case `--log.in-memory` is set to true). 
The default value is `info`, meaning all log messages of types `info`, `warning`, 
`error` and `fatal` will be stored by an instance in memory. 
By setting this option to `warning`, only warning, error and fatal log messages 
will be preserved in memory, and by setting the option to `error` only error 
and fatal messages  will be kept.
This option is useful because the number of in-memory log messages is limited 
to the latest 2048 messages, and these slots are by default shared between 
informational, warning and error messages.
