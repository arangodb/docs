# ArangoDB Server ArangoSearch Options

## Threads

`arangosearch.commit-threads`

The maximum number of threads to use for asynchronous ArangoSearch commit tasks.
The option value must fall in the range `[ 1..4 * NumberOfCores ]`.
Setting it to `0` will automatically choose a sensible number based on the
number of cores in the system.

`arangosearch.commit-threads-idle`

The minimum number of threads to use for asynchronous ArangoSearch commit tasks.
The option value must fall in the range `[ 1..arangosearch.commit-threads ]`.
Setting it to `0` will automatically choose a sensible number based on the
number of cores in the system.

`arangosearch.consolidation-threads`

The maximum number of threads to use for asynchronous ArangoSearch
consolidation tasks.
The option value must fall in the range `[ 1..4 * NumberOfCores ]`.
Setting it to `0` will automatically choose a sensible number based on the
number of cores in the system.

`arangosearch.consolidation-threads-idle`

The minimum number of threads to use for asynchronous ArangoSearch
consolidation tasks.
The option value must fall in the range `[ 1..arangosearch.consolidation-threads ]`.
Setting it to `0` will automatically choose a sensible number based on the
number of cores in the system.

`arangosearch.threads`

<small>Deprecated in: v3.7.5</small>

The exact number of threads to use for asynchronous tasks (0 == autodetect).

{% hint 'info' %}
From version 3.7.5 on, the commit and consolidation thread counts should be
set separately via the following options instead:
- `--arangosearch.commit-threads`
- `--arangosearch.commit-threads-idle`
- `--arangosearch.consolidation-threads`
- `--arangosearch.consolidation-threads-idle`

If either `--arangosearch.commit-threads` or
`--arangosearch.consolidation-threads` is set, then `--arangosearch.threads`
and `arangosearch.threads-limit` are ignored. If only the legacy options are
set, then the commit and consolidation thread counts are calculated as follows:
- Maximum: The smaller value out of `--arangosearch.threads` and
  `arangosearch.threads-limit` divided by 2, but at least 1.
- Minimum: the maximum divided by 2, but at least 1.
{% endhint %}

`arangosearch.threads-limit`

<small>Deprecated in: v3.7.5</small>

Upper limit to the auto-detected number of threads to use for asynchronous
tasks (0 == use default).

{% hint 'info' %}
