# ArangoDB Server Metrics

_arangod_ exports metrics in Prometheus format which can be used to monitor
the healthiness and performance of the system. The thresholds for alerts are
also described for relevant metrics.

{% hint 'warning' %}
The list of exposed metrics is subject to change in every minor version.
While they should stay backwards compatible for the most part, some metrics are
coupled to specific internals that may be replaced by other mechanisms in the
future.
{% endhint %}

## Metrics API v2

{% docublock get_admin_metrics_v2 %}

{% include metrics.md version=page.version.version %}

## Metrics API (deprecated)
