Incompatible changes in ArangoDB 3.8
====================================

It is recommended to check the following list of incompatible changes **before**
upgrading to ArangoDB 3.8, and adjust any client programs if necessary.

The following incompatible changes have been made in ArangoDB 3.8:

### Endpoint return value changes

The endpoint `/_api/replication/clusterInventory` returns, among other things,
an array of the existing collections. Each collection has a `planVersion`
attribute, which in ArangoDB 3.8 is now hard-coded to the value of 1.

Before 3.7, the most recent Plan version from the agency was returned inside
`planVersion` for each collection. In 3.7, the attribute contained the Plan
version that was in use when the in-memory LogicalCollection object was last
constructed. The object was always reconstructed in case the underlying Plan
data for the collection changed, or when a collection contained links to
ArangoSearch Views. This made the attribute relatively useless for any
real-world use cases, and so we are now hard-coding it to simplify the internal
code. Using the attribute in client applications is also deprecated.
