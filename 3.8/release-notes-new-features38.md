Features and Improvements in ArangoDB 3.8
=========================================

The following list shows in detail which features have been added or improved in
ArangoDB 3.8. ArangoDB 3.8 also contains several bug fixes that are not listed
here.

Logging
-------

The following logging-related options have been added:

- added option `--log.use-json-format` to switch log output to JSON format.
  Each log message then produces a separate line with JSON-encoded log data,
  which can be consumed by applications.

  The attributes produced for each log message JSON object are:

  | Key        | Value      |
  |:-----------|:-----------|
  | `time`     | date/time of log message, in format specified by `--log.time-format`
  | `prefix`   | only emitted if `--log.prefix` is set
  | `pid`      | process id, only emitted if `--log.process` is set
  | `tid`      | thread id, only emitted if `--log.thread` is set
  | `thread`   | thread name, only emitted if `--log.thread-name` is set
  | `role`     | server role (1 character), only emitted if `--log.role` is set
  | `level`    | log level (e.g. `"WARN"`, `"INFO"`)
  | `file`     | source file name of log message, only emitted if `--log.file-name` is set
  | `line`     | source file line of log message, only emitted if `--log.file-name` is set 
  | `function` | source file function name, only emitted if `--log.file-name` is set
  | `topic`    | log topic name
  | `id`       | log id (5 digit hexadecimal string), only emitted if `--log.ids` is set
  | `message`  | the actual log message payload

- added option `--log.process` to toggle the logging of the process id
  (pid) in log messages. Logging the process ID is useless when running
  arangod in Docker containers, as the pid will always be 1. So one may
  as well turn it off in these contexts with the new option.

- added option `--log.in-memory` to toggle storing log messages in memory,
  from which they can be consumed via the `/_admin/log` HTTP API and by the 
  Web UI. By default, this option is turned on, so log messages are consumable 
  via the API and UI. Turning this option off will disable that functionality,
  save a tiny bit of memory for the in-memory log buffers and prevent potential
  log information leakage via these means.
