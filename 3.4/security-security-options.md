# Server security options

_arangod_ provides options to make a setup more secure.
Administrators can use these options to limit access to certain ArangoDB
server functionality.

## Security options for managing Foxx applications

_Introduced in: v3.4.8_

The following options are available for controlling the installation of Foxx applications
in an ArangoDB server:

- `--foxx.api`:
  If set to `false`, this option disables the Foxx management API, which will make it
  impossible to install and uninstall Foxx applications. Setting the option to `false`
  will also deactivate the "Services" section in the web interface. 
  The default value is `true`, meaning that Foxx apps can be installed and uninstalled.

- `--foxx.store`:
  If set to `false`, this option disables the Foxx app store in ArangoDB's web interface,
  which will also prevent ArangoDB and its web interface from making calls to the main Foxx 
  application Github repository at
  [github.com/arangodb/foxx-apps](https://github.com/arangodb/foxx-apps){:target="_blank"}.
  The default value is `true`.
