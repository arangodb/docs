Switching the storage engine
----------------------------

In order to use a different storage engine with an existing data directory,
it is required to first create a logical backup of the data using the 
tool [_arangodump_](programs-arangodump.html).

After that, the _arangod_ server process should be restarted with the desired storage
engine selected (this can be done by setting the option *--server.storage-engine*,
or by editing the configuration file of the server) and using a **non-existing data directory**.
If you have deployed using the [_Starter_](programs-starter.html),
instead of _arangod_ you will need to run _arangodb_, and pass to it the option 
*--server.storage-engine* and the option *--starter.data-dir* to set a new
data directory.

When the server is up and running with the desired storage engine, the data
can be re-imported using the tool
[_arangorestore_](programs-arangorestore.html).

Also see [Storage Engines](architecture-storage-engines.html).
