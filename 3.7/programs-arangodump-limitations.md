Arangodump Limitations
======================

_Arangodump_ has the following limitations:

- In a cluster, _arangodump_ does not guarantee to dump a consistent snapshot
  if write operations happen while the dump is in progress (see
  [Hot Backups](backup-restore.html#hot-backups) for an alternative). It is
  therefore recommended not to  perform any data-modification operations on the
  cluster while _arangodump_ is running. This is in contrast to what happens on
  a single instance, a master/slave, or active failover setup, where even if
  write operations are ongoing, the created dump is consistent, as a snapshot
  is taken when the dump starts.
