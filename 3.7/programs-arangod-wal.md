# ArangoDB Server WAL Options (MMFiles)

{% hint 'warning' %}
The MMFiles storage engine was [removed](appendix-deprecated.html).
The startup options still exist for compatibility reasons until the next
major release, but do not have any effect anymore, including in the RocksDB
storage engine.
{% endhint %}
