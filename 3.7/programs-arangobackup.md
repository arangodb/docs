Arangobackup
============

<small>Introduced in: v3.5.1</small>

{% hint 'info' %}
Arangobackup is only available in the
[**Enterprise Edition**](https://www.arangodb.com/why-arangodb/arangodb-enterprise/){:target="_blank"}.
Use [_arangodump_](programs-arangodump.html) and
[_arangorestore_](programs-arangorestore.html) for
[logical backups](backup-restore.html#logical-backups) in the Community Edition.
{% endhint %}

_Arangobackup_ is a command-line client tool for instantaneous and
consistent [hot backups](backup-restore.html#hot-backups) of the data and
structures stored in ArangoDB.

Hot backups rely on hard link magic performed on the database's
persistence layer.

_Arangobackup_ can be used for all ArangoDB deployment modes
(Single Instance, Active Failover, Cluster). It always creates what
is most readily described as a persistence layer consistent snapshot
of the entire instance. Therefore, no such thing as database or
collection level hot backup exists. Consequently, unlike with
_arangodump_/_arangorestore_, one may only restore a hot backup set to
the same layout, for example one can only restore a single server hot backup 
to a single server instance and a 3 _DB-Server_ cluster's hot backup to a 3
_DB-Server_ instance.

Snapshots can be uploaded to or downloaded from remote repositories.

Please review the
[**requirements and limitations**](backup-restore.html#hot-backup-limitations)
of hot backups, specifically regarding storage engine, deployment, scope
and storage space.
