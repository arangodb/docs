| Issue      |
|------------|
| **Date Added:** 2018-09-05 <br> **Component:** AQL <br> **Deployment Mode:** Cluster <br> **Description:** In a very uncommon edge case there is an issue with an optimization rule in the cluster. If you are running a cluster and use a custom shard key on a collection (default is `_key`) **and** you provide a wrong shard key in a modifying query (`UPDATE`, `REPLACE`, `DELETE`) **and** the wrong shard key is on a different shard than the correct one, a `DOCUMENT NOT FOUND` error is returned instead of a modification (example query: `UPDATE { _key: "123", shardKey: "wrongKey"} WITH { foo: "bar" } IN mycollection`). Note that the modification always happens if the rule is switched off, so the suggested  workaround is to [deactivate the optimizing rule](../../aql/execution-and-performance/execution-and-performance-optimizer#turning-specific-optimizer-rules-off) `restrict-to-single-shard`. <br> **Affected Versions:** 3.4.x, 3.5.x, 3.6.x, 3.7.x, 3.8.x, 3.9.x <br> **Fixed in Versions:** - <br> **Reference:** [arangodb/arangodb#6399](https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb/issues/6399) |
| **Date Added:** 2022-08-12 <br> **Component:** AQL <br> **Deployment Mode:** Cluster <br> **Description:** Since ArangoDB 3.8 there was a loophole for creating duplicate keys in the same collection. This was only possible in cluster and needed an AQL query that copied over data from a collection (source) into another (target). The target collection must have more than one shard and must use a custom shard key. Inserting documents into the target collection must have happened via an AQL query like `FOR doc IN source INSERT doc INTO target`. In this particular situation, the document keys (`_key` attribute) from the source collection were used as-is for insertion into the target collection. However, as the target collection is not sharded by `_key` and uses a custom shard key, it is actually not allowed to specify user-defined values for `_key`. Versions before 3.8 failed with the error "must not specifiy _key for this collection" when running such AQL query, but versions between 3.8.0 and 3.9.2 did not. <br> **Affected Versions:** 3.8.0 - 3.8.7, 3.9.0 - 3.9.2 <br> **Fixed in Versions:** 3.8.8, 3.9.3 <br> **Reference:** [arangodb/arangodb#16764](https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb/issues/16764) |

## Schema Validation

| Issue      |
|------------|
| **Date Added:** 2019-03-17 <br> **Component:** Schema Validation <br> **Deployment Mode:** All <br> **Description:** The schema validation cannot pin-point which part of a rule made it fail. This is under investigation but very hard to solve for complex schemas. For example, when using `not` and `anyOf`, this would result in trees of possible errors. For now users should fall back to tools like [jsonschemavalidator.net](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/) <br> **Affected Versions:** 3.7.x, 3.8.x, 3.9.x <br> **Fixed in Versions:** - <br> **Reference:** N/A |

## Other

| Issue      |
|------------|
| **Date Added:** 2019-05-16 <br> **Component:** Starter <br> **Deployment Mode:** All <br> **Description:** The ArangoDB Starter falls back to the IP `[::1]` under macOS. If there is no entry `::1  localhost` in the `/etc/hosts` file or the option `--starter.disable-ipv6` is passed to the starter to use IPv4, then it will hang during startup. <br> **Affected Versions:** 0.14.3 (macOS only) <br> **Fixed in Versions:** - <br> **Reference:** N/A |
| **Date Added:** 2019-05-24 <br> **Component:** Web UI <br> **Deployment Mode:** Active Failover <br> **Description:** The web interface shows a wrong replication mode in the replication tab in Active Failover deployments sometimes. It may display Leader/Follower mode (the default value) because of timeouts if `/_api/cluster/endpoints` is requested too frequently. <br> **Affected Versions:** 3.5.x, 3.6.x, 3.7.x, 3.8.x, 3.9.x <br> **Fixed in Versions:** - <br> **Reference:** N/A |
| **Date Added:** 2019-04-03 <br> **Component:** arangod <br> **Deployment Mode:** Cluster <br> **Description:** Updating the properties of a collection in the cluster may return before the properties are updated consistently on all shards. This is especially visible when setting a schema for a collection with multiple shards, and then instantly starting to store non-conforming documents into the collection. These may be accepted until the properties change has been fully propagated to all shards. <br> **Affected Versions:** 3.7.x, 3.8.x, 3.9.x <br> **Fixed in Versions:** - <br> **Reference:** N/A |
| **Date Added:** 2021-04-07 <br> **Component:** arangod <br> **Deployment Mode:** All <br> **Description:** The Batch API (HTTP endpoint `/_api/batch`) cannot be used in combination with Stream transactions to submit batched requests, because the required header `x-arango-trx-id` is not forwarded. It only processes `Content-Type` and `Content-Id`. <br> **Affected Versions:** 3.5.x, 3.6.x, 3.7.x, 3.8.x, 3.9.x <br> **Fixed in Versions:** - <br> **Reference:** [arangodb/arangodb#13552](https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb/issues/13552) |
