The ArangoDB server (*arangod*) comes with a built-in web interface for
administration. It lets you manage databases, collections, documents,
users, graphs and more. You can also run and explain queries in a
convenient way. Statistics and server status are provided as well.

The web interface (also referred to as Web UI, frontend or *Aardvark*) can be accessed with a
browser under the URL `http://localhost:8529` with default server settings.

The interface differs for standalone instances and cluster setups.
