Foxx services can be deployed in multiple ways:

- [Foxx CLI](../programs-tools/foxx-cli/), a command line tool which
  requires Node.js

- [HTTP API]() using HTTP requests,
  e.g. with curl

- [web interface](../programs-tools/web-interface/programs-web-interface-services) under *SERVICES*

See [the Foxx cluster guide](guides/foxx-guides-cluster#how-arangodb-distributes-services)
for how Foxx services are distributed to Coordinators.
