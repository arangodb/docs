<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/documentRevision.md -->
@startDocuBlock documentRevision


Every document in ArangoDB has a revision, stored in the system attribute
`_rev`. It is fully managed by the server and read-only for the user.

Its value should be treated as opaque, no guarantees regarding its format
and properties are given except that it will be different after a
document update. More specifically, `_rev` values are unique across all
documents and all collections in a single server setup. In a cluster setup,
within one shard it is guaranteed that two different document revisions
have a different `_rev` string, even if they are written in the same
millisecond.

The `_rev` attribute can be used as a pre-condition for queries, to avoid
_lost update_ situations. That is, if a client fetches a document from the server,
modifies it locally (but with the `_rev` attribute untouched) and sends it back
to the server to update the document, but meanwhile the document was changed by
another operation, then the revisions do not match anymore and the operation
is cancelled by the server. Without this mechanism, the client would
accidentally overwrite changes made to the document without knowing about it.

When an existing document is updated or replaced, ArangoDB will write a new
version of this document to the write-ahead logfile (regardless of the
storage engine). When the new version of the document has been written, the
old version(s) will still be present, at least on disk. The same is true when
an existing document (version) gets removed: the old version of the document
plus the removal operation will be on disk for some time.

On disk it is therefore possible that multiple revisions of the same document
(as identified by the same `_key` value) exist at the same time. However,
stale revisions **are not accessible**. Once a document was updated or removed
successfully, no query or other data retrieval operation done by the user
will be able to see it any more. Furthermore, after some time, old revisions
will be removed internally. This is to avoid ever-growing disk usage.

{% hint 'warning' %}
From a **user perspective**, there is just **one single document revision
present per different `_key`** at every point in time. There is no built-in
system to automatically keep a history of all changes done to a document
and old versions of a document can not be restored via the `_rev` value.

@startDocuBlock post_api_cursor

@brief create a cursor and return the first results

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/cursor, Create cursor, createQueryCursor}

A JSON object describing the query and query parameters.

@RESTBODYPARAM{query,string,required,string}
contains the query string to be executed

@RESTBODYPARAM{count,boolean,optional,}
indicates whether the number of documents in the result set should be returned in
the "count" attribute of the result.
Calculating the "count" attribute might have a performance impact for some queries
in the future so this option is turned off by default, and "count"
is only returned when requested.

@RESTBODYPARAM{batchSize,integer,optional,int64}
maximum number of result documents to be transferred from
the server to the client in one roundtrip. If this attribute is
not set, a server-controlled default value will be used. A *batchSize* value of
*0* is disallowed.

@RESTBODYPARAM{ttl,integer,optional,int64}
The time-to-live for the cursor (in seconds). If the result set is small enough
(less than or equal to `batchSize`) then results are returned right away.
Otherwise they are stored in memory and will be accessible via the cursor with
respect to the `ttl`. The cursor will be removed on the server automatically
after the specified amount of time. This is useful to ensure garbage collection
of cursors that are not fully fetched by clients. If not set, a server-defined
value will be used (default: 30 seconds).

@RESTBODYPARAM{cache,boolean,optional,}
flag to determine whether the AQL query results cache
shall be used. If set to *false*, then any query cache lookup will be skipped
for the query. If set to *true*, it will lead to the query cache being checked
for the query if the query cache mode is either *on* or *demand*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{memoryLimit,integer,optional,int64}
the maximum number of memory (measured in bytes) that the query is allowed to
use. If set, then the query will fail with error "resource limit exceeded" in
case it allocates too much memory. A value of *0* indicates that there is no
memory limit.

@RESTBODYPARAM{bindVars,array,optional,object}
key/value pairs representing the bind parameters.

@RESTBODYPARAM{options,object,optional,post_api_cursor_opts}
key/value object with extra options for the query.

@RESTSTRUCT{fullCount,post_api_cursor_opts,boolean,optional,}
if set to *true* and the query contains a *LIMIT* clause, then the
result will have an *extra* attribute with the sub-attributes *stats*
and *fullCount*, `{ ... , "extra": { "stats": { "fullCount": 123 } } }`.
The *fullCount* attribute will contain the number of documents in the result before the
last top-level LIMIT in the query was applied. It can be used to count the number of
documents that match certain filter criteria, but only return a subset of them, in one go.
It is thus similar to MySQL's *SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS* hint. Note that setting the option
will disable a few LIMIT optimizations and may lead to more documents being processed,
and thus make queries run longer. Note that the *fullCount* attribute may only
be present in the result if the query has a top-level LIMIT clause and the LIMIT
clause is actually used in the query.

@RESTSTRUCT{maxPlans,post_api_cursor_opts,integer,optional,int64}
Limits the maximum number of plans that are created by the AQL query optimizer.

@RESTSTRUCT{maxWarningCount,post_api_cursor_opts,integer,optional,int64}
Limits the maximum number of warnings a query will return. The number of warnings
a query will return is limited to 10 by default, but that number can be increased
or decreased by setting this attribute.

@RESTSTRUCT{failOnWarning,post_api_cursor_opts,boolean,optional,}
When set to *true*, the query will throw an exception and abort instead of producing
a warning. This option should be used during development to catch potential issues
early. When the attribute is set to *false*, warnings will not be propagated to
exceptions and will be returned with the query result.
There is also a server configuration option `--query.fail-on-warning` for setting the
default value for *failOnWarning* so it does not need to be set on a per-query level.

@RESTSTRUCT{stream,post_api_cursor_opts,boolean,optional,}
Can be enabled to execute the query lazily. If set to *true*, then the query is
executed as long as necessary to produce up to `batchSize` results. These
results are returned immediately and the query is suspended until the client
asks for the next batch (if there are more results). Depending on the query
this can mean that the first results will be available much faster and that
less memory is needed because the server only needs to store a subset of
results at a time. Read-only queries can benefit the most, unless `SORT`
without index or `COLLECT` are involved that make it necessary to process all
documents before a partial result can be returned. It is advisable to only use
this option for queries without exclusive locks.

Remarks:
- The query will hold resources until it ends (such as RocksDB snapshots, which
  prevents compaction to some degree). Writes will be in memory until the query
  is committed.
- If existing documents are modified, then write locks are held on these
  documents and other queries trying to modify the same documents will fail
  because of this conflict.
- A streaming query may fail late because of a conflict or for other reasons
  after some batches were already returned successfully, possibly rendering the
  results up to that point meaningless.
- The query options `cache`, `count` and `fullCount` are not supported for
  streaming queries.
- Query statistics, profiling data and warnings are delivered as part of the
  last batch.

If the `stream` option is *false* (default), then the complete result of the
query is calculated before any of it is returned to the client. The server
stores the full result in memory (on the contacted Coordinator if in a cluster).
All other resources are freed immediately (locks, RocksDB snapshots). The query
will fail before it returns results in case of a conflict.

@RESTSTRUCT{optimizer,post_api_cursor_opts,object,optional,post_api_cursor_opts_optimizer}
Options related to the query optimizer.

@RESTSTRUCT{rules,post_api_cursor_opts_optimizer,array,optional,string}
A list of to-be-included or to-be-excluded optimizer rules can be put into this
attribute, telling the optimizer to include or exclude specific rules. To disable
a rule, prefix its name with a `-`, to enable a rule, prefix it with a `+`. There is
also a pseudo-rule `all`, which matches all optimizer rules. `-all` disables all rules.

@RESTSTRUCT{profile,post_api_cursor_opts,integer,optional,}
If set to *true* or *1*, then the additional query profiling information will be returned
in the sub-attribute *profile* of the *extra* return attribute, if the query result
is not served from the query cache. Set to *2* the query will include execution stats
per query plan node in sub-attribute *stats.nodes* of the *extra* return attribute.
Additionally the query plan is returned in the sub-attribute *extra.plan*.

@RESTSTRUCT{satelliteSyncWait,post_api_cursor_opts,number,optional,double}
This *Enterprise Edition* parameter allows to configure how long a DB-Server will have time
to bring the SatelliteCollections involved in the query into sync.
The default value is *60.0* (seconds). When the max time has been reached the query
will be stopped.

@RESTSTRUCT{maxRuntime,post_api_cursor_opts,number,optional,double}
The query has to be executed within the given runtime or it will be killed.
The value is specified in seconds. The default value is *0.0* (no timeout).

@RESTSTRUCT{maxTransactionSize,post_api_cursor_opts,integer,optional,int64}
Transaction size limit in bytes. Honored by the RocksDB storage engine only.

@RESTSTRUCT{intermediateCommitSize,post_api_cursor_opts,integer,optional,int64}
Maximum total size of operations after which an intermediate commit is performed
automatically. Honored by the RocksDB storage engine only.

@RESTSTRUCT{intermediateCommitCount,post_api_cursor_opts,integer,optional,int64}
Maximum number of operations after which an intermediate commit is performed
automatically. Honored by the RocksDB storage engine only.

@RESTSTRUCT{skipInaccessibleCollections,post_api_cursor_opts,boolean,optional,}
AQL queries (especially graph traversals) will treat collection to which a user has no access rights as if these collections were empty. Instead of returning a forbidden access error, your queries will execute normally. This is intended to help with certain use-cases: A graph contains several collections and different users execute AQL queries on that graph. You can now naturally limit the accessible results by changing the access rights of users on collections. This feature is only available in the Enterprise Edition.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
The query details include the query string plus optional query options and
bind parameters. These values need to be passed in a JSON representation in
the body of the POST request.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the result set can be created by the server.

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
A flag to indicate that an error occurred (*false* in this case)

@RESTREPLYBODY{code,integer,required,integer}
the HTTP status code

@RESTREPLYBODY{result,array,optional,}
an array of result documents (might be empty if query has no results)

@RESTREPLYBODY{hasMore,boolean,required,}
A boolean indicator whether there are more results
available for the cursor on the server

@RESTREPLYBODY{count,integer,optional,int64}
the total number of result documents available (only
available if the query was executed with the *count* attribute set)

@RESTREPLYBODY{id,string,required,string}
id of temporary cursor created on the server (optional, see above)

@RESTREPLYBODY{extra,object,optional,}
an optional JSON object with extra information about the query result
contained in its *stats* sub-attribute. For data-modification queries, the
*extra.stats* sub-attribute will contain the number of modified documents and
the number of documents that could not be modified
due to an error (if *ignoreErrors* query option is specified)

@RESTREPLYBODY{cached,boolean,required,}
a boolean flag indicating whether the query result was served
from the query cache or not. If the query result is served from the query
cache, the *extra* return attribute will not contain any *stats* sub-attribute
and no *profile* sub-attribute.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the JSON representation is malformed or the query specification is
missing from the request.

If the JSON representation is malformed or the query specification is
missing from the request, the server will respond with *HTTP 400*.

The body of the response will contain a JSON object with additional error
details. The object has the following attributes:

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
boolean flag to indicate that an error occurred (*true* in this case)

@RESTREPLYBODY{code,integer,required,int64}
the HTTP status code

@RESTREPLYBODY{errorNum,integer,required,int64}
the server error number

@RESTREPLYBODY{errorMessage,string,required,string}
a descriptive error message<br>
If the query specification is complete, the server will process the query. If an
error occurs during query processing, the server will respond with *HTTP 400*.
Again, the body of the response will contain details about the error.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
The server will respond with *HTTP 404* in case a non-existing collection is
accessed in the query.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
The server will respond with *HTTP 405* if an unsupported HTTP method is used.

@brief dispose an existing cursor

@RESTHEADER{DELETE /_api/cursor/{cursor-identifier}, Delete cursor, deleteQueryCursor}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{cursor-identifier,string,required}
The id of the cursor

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Deletes the cursor and frees the resources associated with it.

The cursor will automatically be destroyed on the server when the client has
retrieved all documents from it. The client can also explicitly destroy the
cursor at any earlier time using an HTTP DELETE request. The cursor id must
be included as part of the URL.

Note: the server will also destroy abandoned cursors automatically after a
certain server-controlled timeout to avoid resource leakage.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
is returned if the server is aware of the cursor.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the server is not aware of the cursor. It is also
returned if a cursor is used after it has been destroyed.

@startDocuBlock put_api_cursor_identifier

@brief return the next results from an existing cursor

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/cursor/{cursor-identifier}, Read next batch from cursor (deprecated), modifyQueryCursorPut}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
This endpoint is deprecated in favor its functionally equivalent POST counterpart.
{% endhint %}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{cursor-identifier,string,required}
The name of the cursor

@RESTDESCRIPTION
If the cursor is still alive, returns an object with the following
attributes:

- *id*: the *cursor-identifier*
- *result*: a list of documents for the current batch
- *hasMore*: *false* if this was the last batch
- *count*: if present the total number of elements

Note that even if *hasMore* returns *true*, the next call might
still return no documents. If, however, *hasMore* is *false*, then
the cursor is exhausted.  Once the *hasMore* attribute has a value of
*false*, the client can stop.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
The server will respond with *HTTP 200* in case of success.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the cursor identifier is omitted, the server will respond with *HTTP 404*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If no cursor with the specified identifier can be found, the server will respond
with *HTTP 404*.

@EXAMPLES

Valid request for next batch

@startDocuBlock post_api_cursor_identifier

@brief return the next results from an existing cursor

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/cursor/{cursor-identifier}, Read next batch from cursor, modifyQueryCursorPost}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{cursor-identifier,string,required}
The name of the cursor

@RESTDESCRIPTION
If the cursor is still alive, returns an object with the following
attributes:

- *id*: the *cursor-identifier*
- *result*: a list of documents for the current batch
- *hasMore*: *false* if this was the last batch
- *count*: if present the total number of elements

Note that even if *hasMore* returns *true*, the next call might
still return no documents. If, however, *hasMore* is *false*, then
the cursor is exhausted.  Once the *hasMore* attribute has a value of
*false*, the client can stop.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
The server will respond with *HTTP 200* in case of success.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the cursor identifier is omitted, the server will respond with *HTTP 404*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If no cursor with the specified identifier can be found, the server will respond
with *HTTP 404*.

@EXAMPLES

@startDocuBlock post_api_view_arangosearch

@brief creates an ArangoSearch View

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/view#arangosearch, Create an ArangoSearch View, createView}

@RESTBODYPARAM{name,string,required,string}
The name of the View.

@RESTBODYPARAM{type,string,required,string}
The type of the View. Must be equal to *"arangosearch"*.
This option is immutable.

@RESTBODYPARAM{links,object,optional,}
Expects an object with the attribute keys being names of to be linked collections,
and the link properties as attribute values. See
[ArangoSearch View Link Properties](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/arangosearch-views.html#link-properties)
for details.

@RESTBODYPARAM{primarySort,array,optional,object}
A primary sort order can be defined to enable an AQL optimization. If a query
iterates over all documents of a View, wants to sort them by attribute values
and the (left-most) fields to sort by as well as their sorting direction match
with the *primarySort* definition, then the `SORT` operation is optimized away.
This option is immutable.<br/>
Expects an array of objects, each specifying a field (attribute path) and a
sort direction (`"asc` for ascending, `"desc"` for descending):
`[ { "field": "attr", "direction": "asc"}, … ]`

@RESTBODYPARAM{primarySortCompression,string,optional,string}
Defines how to compress the primary sort data (introduced in v3.7.1).
ArangoDB v3.5 and v3.6 always compress the index using LZ4.
This option is immutable.
- `"lz4"` (default): use LZ4 fast compression.
- `"none"`: disable compression to trade space for speed.

@RESTBODYPARAM{storedValues,array,optional,object}
An array of objects to describe which document attributes to store in the View
index (introduced in v3.7.1). It can then cover search queries, which means the
data can be taken from the index directly and accessing the storage engine can
be avoided.<br/>
Each object is expected in the form
`{ "fields": [ "attr1", "attr2", ... "attrN" ], "compression": "none" }`,
where the required `fields` attribute is an array of strings with one or more
document attribute paths. The specified attributes are placed into a single
column of the index. A column with all fields that are involved in common
search queries is ideal for performance. The column should not include too many
unneeded fields however. The optional `compression` attribute defines the
compression type used for the internal column-store, which can be `"lz4"`
(LZ4 fast compression, default) or `"none"` (no compression).<br/>
This option is immutable. Not to be confused with `storeValues`, which allows
to store meta data about attribute values in the View index.

@RESTBODYPARAM{cleanupIntervalStep,integer,optional,int64}
Wait at least this many commits between removing unused files in the
ArangoSearch data directory (default: 2, to disable use: 0).
For the case where the consolidation policies merge segments often (i.e. a lot
of commit+consolidate), a lower value will cause a lot of disk space to be
wasted.
For the case where the consolidation policies rarely merge segments (i.e. few
inserts/deletes), a higher value will impact performance without any added
benefits.<br/>
_Background:_
  With every "commit" or "consolidate" operation a new state of the View
  internal data-structures is created on disk.
  Old states/snapshots are released once there are no longer any users
  remaining.
  However, the files for the released states/snapshots are left on disk, and
  only removed by "cleanup" operation.

@RESTBODYPARAM{commitIntervalMsec,integer,optional,int64}
Wait at least this many milliseconds between committing View data store
changes and making documents visible to queries (default: 1000, to disable
use: 0).
For the case where there are a lot of inserts/updates, a lower value, until
commit, will cause the index not to account for them and memory usage would
continue to grow.
For the case where there are a few inserts/updates, a higher value will impact
performance and waste disk space for each commit call without any added
benefits.<br/>
_Background:_
  For data retrieval ArangoSearch Views follow the concept of
  "eventually-consistent", i.e. eventually all the data in ArangoDB will be
  matched by corresponding query expressions.
  The concept of ArangoSearch View "commit" operation is introduced to
  control the upper-bound on the time until document addition/removals are
  actually reflected by corresponding query expressions.
  Once a "commit" operation is complete all documents added/removed prior to
  the start of the "commit" operation will be reflected by queries invoked in
  subsequent ArangoDB transactions, in-progress ArangoDB transactions will
  still continue to return a repeatable-read state.

@RESTBODYPARAM{consolidationIntervalMsec,integer,optional,int64}
Wait at least this many milliseconds between applying 'consolidationPolicy' to
consolidate View data store and possibly release space on the filesystem
(default: 10000, to disable use: 0).
For the case where there are a lot of data modification operations, a higher
value could potentially have the data store consume more space and file handles.
For the case where there are a few data modification operations, a lower value
will impact performance due to no segment candidates available for
consolidation.<br/>
_Background:_
  For data modification ArangoSearch Views follow the concept of a
  "versioned data store". Thus old versions of data may be removed once there
  are no longer any users of the old data. The frequency of the cleanup and
  compaction operations are governed by 'consolidationIntervalMsec' and the
  candidates for compaction are selected via 'consolidationPolicy'.

@RESTBODYPARAM{consolidationPolicy,object,optional,}
The consolidation policy to apply for selecting which segments should be merged
(default: {})<br/>
_Background:_
  With each ArangoDB transaction that inserts documents one or more
  ArangoSearch internal segments gets created.
  Similarly for removed documents the segments that contain such documents
  will have these documents marked as 'deleted'.
  Over time this approach causes a lot of small and sparse segments to be
  created.
  A "consolidation" operation selects one or more segments and copies all of
  their valid documents into a single new segment, thereby allowing the
  search algorithm to perform more optimally and for extra file handles to be
  released once old segments are no longer used.<br/>
Sub-properties:
  - `type` (string, _optional_):
    The segment candidates for the "consolidation" operation are selected based
    upon several possible configurable formulas as defined by their types.
    The currently supported types are:
    - `"tier"` (default): consolidate based on segment byte size and live
      document count as dictated by the customization attributes. If this type
      is used, then below `segments*` and `minScore` properties are available.
    - `"bytes_accum"`: consolidate if and only if
      `{threshold} > (segment_bytes + sum_of_merge_candidate_segment_bytes) / all_segment_bytes`
      i.e. the sum of all candidate segment byte size is less than the total
      segment byte size multiplied by the `{threshold}`. If this type is used,
      then below `threshold` property is available.
  - `threshold` (number, _optional_): value in the range `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `segmentsBytesFloor` (number, _optional_): Defines the value (in bytes) to
    treat all smaller segments as equal for consolidation selection
    (default: 2097152)
  - `segmentsBytesMax` (number, _optional_): Maximum allowed size of all
    consolidated segments in bytes (default: 5368709120)
  - `segmentsMax` (number, _optional_): The maximum number of segments that will
    be evaluated as candidates for consolidation (default: 10)
  - `segmentsMin` (number, _optional_): The minimum number of segments that will
    be evaluated as candidates for consolidation (default: 1)
  - `minScore` (number, _optional_): (default: 0)

@RESTBODYPARAM{writebufferIdle,integer,optional,int64}
Maximum number of writers (segments) cached in the pool
(default: 64, use 0 to disable, immutable)

@RESTBODYPARAM{writebufferActive,integer,optional,int64}
Maximum number of concurrent active writers (segments) that perform a
transaction. Other writers (segments) wait till current active writers
(segments) finish (default: 0, use 0 to disable, immutable)

@RESTBODYPARAM{writebufferSizeMax,integer,optional,int64}
Maximum memory byte size per writer (segment) before a writer (segment) flush
is triggered. `0` value turns off this limit for any writer (buffer) and data
will be flushed periodically based on the value defined for the flush thread
(ArangoDB server startup option). `0` value should be used carefully due to
high potential memory consumption
(default: 33554432, use 0 to disable, immutable)

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Creates a new View with a given name and properties if it does not
already exist.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the *name* or *type* attribute are missing or invalid, then an *HTTP 400*
error is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{409}
If a View called *name* already exists, then an *HTTP 409* error is returned.

@startDocuBlock put_api_view_properties_arangosearch

@brief changes all properties of an ArangoSearch View

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/view/{view-name}/properties#ArangoSearch, Change properties of an ArangoSearch View, modifyView}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{view-name,string,required}
The name of the View.

@RESTBODYPARAM{links,object,optional,}
Expects an object with the attribute keys being names of to be linked collections,
and the link properties as attribute values. See
[ArangoSearch View Link Properties](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/arangosearch-views.html#link-properties)
for details.

@RESTBODYPARAM{cleanupIntervalStep,integer,optional,int64}
Wait at least this many commits between removing unused files in the
ArangoSearch data directory (default: 2, to disable use: 0).
For the case where the consolidation policies merge segments often (i.e. a lot
of commit+consolidate), a lower value will cause a lot of disk space to be
wasted.
For the case where the consolidation policies rarely merge segments (i.e. few
inserts/deletes), a higher value will impact performance without any added
benefits.<br/>
_Background:_
  With every "commit" or "consolidate" operation a new state of the View
  internal data-structures is created on disk.
  Old states/snapshots are released once there are no longer any users
  remaining.
  However, the files for the released states/snapshots are left on disk, and
  only removed by "cleanup" operation.

@RESTBODYPARAM{commitIntervalMsec,integer,optional,int64}
Wait at least this many milliseconds between committing View data store
changes and making documents visible to queries (default: 1000, to disable
use: 0).
For the case where there are a lot of inserts/updates, a lower value, until
commit, will cause the index not to account for them and memory usage would
continue to grow.
For the case where there are a few inserts/updates, a higher value will impact
performance and waste disk space for each commit call without any added
benefits.<br/>
_Background:_
  For data retrieval ArangoSearch Views follow the concept of
  "eventually-consistent", i.e. eventually all the data in ArangoDB will be
  matched by corresponding query expressions.
  The concept of ArangoSearch View "commit" operation is introduced to
  control the upper-bound on the time until document addition/removals are
  actually reflected by corresponding query expressions.
  Once a "commit" operation is complete all documents added/removed prior to
  the start of the "commit" operation will be reflected by queries invoked in
  subsequent ArangoDB transactions, in-progress ArangoDB transactions will
  still continue to return a repeatable-read state.

@RESTBODYPARAM{consolidationIntervalMsec,integer,optional,int64}
Wait at least this many milliseconds between applying 'consolidationPolicy' to
consolidate View data store and possibly release space on the filesystem
(default: 10000, to disable use: 0).
For the case where there are a lot of data modification operations, a higher
value could potentially have the data store consume more space and file handles.
For the case where there are a few data modification operations, a lower value
will impact performance due to no segment candidates available for
consolidation.<br/>
_Background:_
  For data modification ArangoSearch Views follow the concept of a
  "versioned data store". Thus old versions of data may be removed once there
  are no longer any users of the old data. The frequency of the cleanup and
  compaction operations are governed by 'consolidationIntervalMsec' and the
  candidates for compaction are selected via 'consolidationPolicy'.

@RESTBODYPARAM{consolidationPolicy,object,optional,}
The consolidation policy to apply for selecting which segments should be merged
(default: {})<br/>
_Background:_
  With each ArangoDB transaction that inserts documents one or more
  ArangoSearch internal segments gets created.
  Similarly for removed documents the segments that contain such documents
  will have these documents marked as 'deleted'.
  Over time this approach causes a lot of small and sparse segments to be
  created.
  A "consolidation" operation selects one or more segments and copies all of
  their valid documents into a single new segment, thereby allowing the
  search algorithm to perform more optimally and for extra file handles to be
  released once old segments are no longer used.<br/>
Sub-properties:
  - `type` (string, _optional_):
    The segment candidates for the "consolidation" operation are selected based
    upon several possible configurable formulas as defined by their types.
    The currently supported types are:
    - `"tier"` (default): consolidate based on segment byte size and live
      document count as dictated by the customization attributes. If this type
      is used, then below `segments*` and `minScore` properties are available.
    - `"bytes_accum"`: consolidate if and only if
      `{threshold} > (segment_bytes + sum_of_merge_candidate_segment_bytes) / all_segment_bytes`
      i.e. the sum of all candidate segment byte size is less than the total
      segment byte size multiplied by the `{threshold}`. If this type is used,
      then below `threshold` property is available.
  - `threshold` (number, _optional_): value in the range `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `segmentsBytesFloor` (number, _optional_): Defines the value (in bytes) to
    treat all smaller segments as equal for consolidation selection
    (default: 2097152)
  - `segmentsBytesMax` (number, _optional_): Maximum allowed size of all
    consolidated segments in bytes (default: 5368709120)
  - `segmentsMax` (number, _optional_): The maximum number of segments that will
    be evaluated as candidates for consolidation (default: 10)
  - `segmentsMin` (number, _optional_): The minimum number of segments that will
    be evaluated as candidates for consolidation (default: 1)
  - `minScore` (number, _optional_): (default: 0)

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Changes the properties of a View by replacing them.

On success an object with the following attributes is returned:
- *id*: The identifier of the View
- *name*: The name of the View
- *type*: The View type
- all additional ArangoSearch View implementation specific properties

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the *view-name* is missing, then a *HTTP 400* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *view-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404* is returned.

- *type*: the index type

All other attributes are type-dependent. For example, some indexes provide
*unique* or *sparse* flags, whereas others don't. Some indexes also provide
a selectivity estimate in the *selectivityEstimate* attribute of the result.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the index exists, then a *HTTP 200* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the index does not exist, then a *HTTP 404*
is returned.

@startDocuBlock post_api_index_hash

@brief creates a hash index

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/index#hash, Create hash index, createIndex:hash}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The collection name.

@RESTBODYPARAM{type,string,required,string}
must be equal to *"hash"*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{fields,array,required,string}
an array of attribute paths.

@RESTBODYPARAM{unique,boolean,required,}
if *true*, then create a unique index.

@RESTBODYPARAM{sparse,boolean,required,}
if *true*, then create a sparse index.

@RESTBODYPARAM{deduplicate,boolean,optional,}
if *false*, the deduplication of array values is turned off.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Creates a hash index for the collection *collection-name* if it
does not already exist. The call expects an object containing the index
details.

In a sparse index all documents will be excluded from the index that do not
contain at least one of the specified index attributes (i.e. *fields*) or that
have a value of *null* in any of the specified index attributes. Such documents
will not be indexed, and not be taken into account for uniqueness checks if
the *unique* flag is set.

In a non-sparse index, these documents will be indexed (for non-present
indexed attributes, a value of *null* will be used) and will be taken into
account for uniqueness checks if the *unique* flag is set.

**Note**: unique indexes on non-shard keys are not supported in a cluster.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the index already exists, then a *HTTP 200* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
If the index does not already exist and could be created, then a *HTTP 201*
is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the collection already contains documents and you try to create a unique
hash index in such a way that there are documents violating the uniqueness,
then a *HTTP 400* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404* is returned.

@brief creates a geo index

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/index#geo, Create geo-spatial index, createIndex#geo}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The collection name.

@RESTBODYPARAM{type,string,required,string}
must be equal to *"geo"*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{fields,array,required,string}
An array with one or two attribute paths.<br>
If it is an array with one attribute path *location*, then a geo-spatial
index on all documents is created using *location* as path to the
coordinates. The value of the attribute must be an array with at least two
double values. The array must contain the latitude (first value) and the
longitude (second value). All documents, which do not have the attribute
path or with value that are not suitable, are ignored.<br>
If it is an array with two attribute paths *latitude* and *longitude*,
then a geo-spatial index on all documents is created using *latitude*
and *longitude* as paths the latitude and the longitude. The value of
the attribute *latitude* and of the attribute *longitude* must a
double. All documents, which do not have the attribute paths or which
values are not suitable, are ignored.

@RESTBODYPARAM{geoJson,string,required,string}
If a geo-spatial index on a *location* is constructed
and *geoJson* is *true*, then the order within the array is longitude
followed by latitude. This corresponds to the format described in
http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#positions

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Creates a geo-spatial index in the collection *collection-name*, if
it does not already exist. Expects an object containing the index details.

Geo indexes are always sparse, meaning that documents that do not contain
the index attributes or have non-numeric values in the index attributes
will not be indexed.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the index already exists, then a *HTTP 200* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
If the index does not already exist and could be created, then a *HTTP 201*
is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404* is returned.

@startDocuBlock post_api_index_persistent

@brief creates a persistent index

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/index#persistent, Create a persistent index, createIndex:persistent}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The collection name.

@RESTBODYPARAM{type,string,required,string}
must be equal to *"persistent"*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{fields,array,required,string}
an array of attribute paths.

@RESTBODYPARAM{unique,boolean,optional,}
if *true*, then create a unique index.

@RESTBODYPARAM{sparse,boolean,optional,}
if *true*, then create a sparse index.

@RESTBODYPARAM{deduplicate,boolean,optional,}
The attribute **deduplicate** is supported by array indexes of type *persistent*,
*hash* or *skiplist*. It controls whether inserting duplicate index values
from the same document into a unique array index will lead to a unique constraint
error or not. The default value is *true*, so only a single instance of each
non-unique index value will be inserted into the index per document. Trying to
insert a value into the index that already exists in the index will always fail,
regardless of the value of this attribute.

@RESTBODYPARAM{estimates,boolean,optional,}
The attribute **estimates** is supported by indexes of type *persistent*. This
attribute controls whether index selectivity estimates are maintained for the
index. Not maintaining index selectivity estimates can have a slightly positive
impact on write performance.
The downside of turning off index selectivity estimates will be that
the query optimizer will not be able to determine the usefulness of different
competing indexes in AQL queries when there are multiple candidate indexes to
choose from.
The *estimates* attribute is optional and defaults to *true* if not set. It will
have no effect on indexes other than *persistent* (with *hash* and *skiplist*
being mere aliases for *persistent* nowadays).

@RESTDESCRIPTION

Creates a persistent index for the collection *collection-name*, if
it does not already exist. The call expects an object containing the index
details.

In a sparse index all documents will be excluded from the index that do not
contain at least one of the specified index attributes (i.e. *fields*) or that
have a value of *null* in any of the specified index attributes. Such documents
will not be indexed, and not be taken into account for uniqueness checks if
the *unique* flag is set.

In a non-sparse index, these documents will be indexed (for non-present
indexed attributes, a value of *null* will be used) and will be taken into
account for uniqueness checks if the *unique* flag is set.

**Note**: unique indexes on non-shard keys are not supported in a cluster.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the index already exists, then a *HTTP 200* is
returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
If the index does not already exist and could be created, then a *HTTP 201*
is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the collection already contains documents and you try to create a unique
persistent index in such a way that there are documents violating the
uniqueness, then a *HTTP 400* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404* is returned.

@startDocuBlock post_api_index

@brief creates an index

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/index#general, Create index, createIndex:general}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The collection name.

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{index-details,json,required}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Creates a new index in the collection *collection*. Expects
an object containing the index details.

The type of the index to be created must specified in the *type*
attribute of the index details. Depending on the index type, additional
other attributes may need to specified in the request in order to create
the index.

Indexes require the to be indexed attribute(s) in the *fields* attribute
of the index details. Depending on the index type, a single attribute or
multiple attributes can be indexed. In the latter case, an array of
strings is expected.

Indexing the system attribute *_id* is not supported for user-defined indexes.
Manually creating an index using *_id* as an index attribute will fail with
an error.

Optionally, an index name may be specified as a string in the *name* attribute.
Index names have the same restrictions as collection names. If no value is
specified, one will be auto-generated.

Some indexes can be created as unique or non-unique variants. Uniqueness
can be controlled for most indexes by specifying the *unique* flag in the
index details. Setting it to *true* will create a unique index.
Setting it to *false* or omitting the *unique* attribute will
create a non-unique index.

**Note**: The following index types do not support uniqueness, and using
the *unique* attribute with these types may lead to an error:

- geo indexes
- fulltext indexes

**Note**: Unique indexes on non-shard keys are not supported in a
cluster.

Hash, skiplist and persistent indexes can optionally be created in a sparse
variant. A sparse index will be created if the *sparse* attribute in
the index details is set to *true*. Sparse indexes do not index documents
for which any of the index attributes is either not set or is *null*.

The optional attribute **deduplicate** is supported by array indexes of type
*persistent*, *hash* or *skiplist*. It controls whether inserting duplicate index values
from the same document into a unique array index will lead to a unique constraint
error or not. The default value is *true*, so only a single instance of each
non-unique index value will be inserted into the index per document. Trying to
insert a value into the index that already exists in the index will always fail,
regardless of the value of this attribute.

The optional attribute **estimates** is supported by indexes of type
*persistent*. This attribute controls whether index selectivity estimates are
maintained for the index. Not maintaining index selectivity estimates can have
a slightly positive impact on write performance.
The downside of turning off index selectivity estimates will be that
the query optimizer will not be able to determine the usefulness of different
competing indexes in AQL queries when there are multiple candidate indexes to
choose from.
The *estimates* attribute is optional and defaults to *true* if not set. It will
have no effect on indexes other than *persistent* (with *hash* and *skiplist*
being mere aliases for *persistent* nowadays).

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
If the index does not already exist and could be created, then an *HTTP 201*
is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If an invalid index description is posted or attributes are used that the
target index will not support, then an *HTTP 400* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If *collection* is unknown, then an *HTTP 404* is returned.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The collection name.

@RESTBODYPARAM{type,string,required,string}
must be equal to *"skiplist"*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{fields,array,required,string}
an array of attribute paths.

@RESTBODYPARAM{unique,boolean,required,}
if *true*, then create a unique index.

@RESTBODYPARAM{sparse,boolean,required,}
if *true*, then create a sparse index.

@RESTBODYPARAM{deduplicate,boolean,optional,}
if *false*, the deduplication of array values is turned off.

@RESTDESCRIPTION

Creates a skip-list index for the collection *collection-name*, if
it does not already exist. The call expects an object containing the index
details.

In a sparse index all documents will be excluded from the index that do not
contain at least one of the specified index attributes (i.e. *fields*) or that
have a value of *null* in any of the specified index attributes. Such documents
will not be indexed, and not be taken into account for uniqueness checks if

is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the collection already contains documents and you try to create a unique
skip-list index in such a way that there are documents violating the
uniqueness, then a *HTTP 400* is returned.

@brief creates a fulltext index

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/index#fulltext, Create fulltext index, createIndex#fulltext}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The collection name.

@RESTBODYPARAM{type,string,required,string}
must be equal to *"fulltext"*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{fields,array,required,string}
an array of attribute names. Currently, the array is limited
to exactly one attribute.

@RESTBODYPARAM{minLength,integer,required,int64}
Minimum character length of words to index. Will default
to a server-defined value if unspecified. It is thus recommended to set
this value explicitly when creating the index.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Creates a fulltext index for the collection *collection-name*, if
it does not already exist. The call expects an object containing the index
details.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the index already exists, then a *HTTP 200* is
returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
If the index does not already exist and could be created, then a *HTTP 201*
is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404* is returned.

@brief creates a TTL (time-to-live) index

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/index#ttl, Create TTL index, createIndex:ttl}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The collection name.

@RESTBODYPARAM{type,string,required,string}
must be equal to *"ttl"*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{fields,array,required,string}
an array with exactly one attribute path.

@RESTBODYPARAM{expireAfter,number,required,}
The time interval (in seconds) from the point in time stored in the `fields`
attribute after which the documents count as expired. Can be set to `0` to let
documents expire as soon as the server time passes the point in time stored in
the document attribute, or to a higher number to delay the expiration.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Creates a TTL index for the collection *collection-name* if it
does not already exist. The call expects an object containing the index
details.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the index already exists, then a *HTTP 200* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
If the index does not already exist and could be created, then a *HTTP 201*
is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the collection already contains another TTL index, then an *HTTP 400* is
returned, as there can be at most one TTL index per collection.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404* is returned.

@brief download a specific local backup

@RESTHEADER{POST /_admin/backup/download, Download a backup from a remote repository}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Download a specific local backup from a remote repository, or query
progress on a previously scheduled download operation, or abort
a running download operation.

@RESTBODYPARAM{id,string,optional,string}
The identifier for this backup. This is required when a download
operation is scheduled. In this case leave out the `downloadId`
attribute.

@RESTBODYPARAM{remoteRepository,string,required,string}
URL of remote repository. This is required when a download operation is
scheduled. In this case leave out the `downloadId` attribute. Provided
repository URLs are normalized and validated as follows: One single colon must
appear separating the configuration section name and the path. The URL prefix
up to the colon must exist as a key in the config object below. No slashes must
appear before the colon. Multiple back to back slashes are collapsed to one, as
`..` and `.` are applied accordingly. Local repositories must be absolute paths
and must begin with a `/`. Trailing `/` are removed.

@RESTBODYPARAM{config,object,required,object}
Configuration of remote repository. This is required when a download
operation is scheduled. In this case leave out the `downloadId`
attribute. See the description of the _arangobackup_ program in the manual
for a description of the `config` object.

@RESTBODYPARAM{downloadId,string,optional,string}
Download ID to specify for which download operation progress is queried, or
the download operation to abort.
If you specify this, leave out all the above body parameters.

@RESTBODYPARAM{abort,boolean,optional,}
Set this to `true` if a running download operation should be aborted. In
this case, the only other body parameter which is needed is `downloadId`.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If all is well, code 200 is returned if progress is inquired or the
operation is aborted.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
If all is well, code 202 is returned if a new operation is scheduled.

@brief restores from a local backup

@RESTHEADER{POST /_admin/backup/restore, Restore backup}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Restores a consistent backup from a
snapshot in time, with a given id. The backup snapshot must reside on
the ArangoDB service locally.

@RESTBODYPARAM{id,string,required,string}
The id of the backup to restore from.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
Is returned if the backup could be restored. Note that there is an
inevitable discrepancy between the single server and the cluster. In a
single server, the request returns successfully, but the restore is
only executed afterwards. In the cluster, the request only returns when
the restore operation has been completed successfully. The cluster
behaviour is obviously the desired one, but in a single instance, one
cannot keep a connection open across a restart.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the restore command is invoked with bad parameters or any HTTP
method other than `POST`, then an *HTTP 400* is returned. The specifics
are detailed in the returned error document.

@brief upload a specific local backup

@RESTHEADER{POST /_admin/backup/upload, Upload a backup to a remote repository}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Upload a specific local backup to a remote repository, or query
progress on a previously scheduled upload operation, or abort
a running upload operation.

@RESTBODYPARAM{id,string,optional,string}
The identifier for this backup. This is required when an upload
operation is scheduled. In this case leave out the `uploadId`
attribute.

@RESTBODYPARAM{remoteRepository,string,optional,string}
URL of remote repository. This is required when an upload operation is
scheduled. In this case leave out the `uploadId` attribute. Provided repository
URLs are normalized and validated as follows: One single colon must appear
separating the configuration section name and the path. The URL prefix up to
the colon must exist as a key in the config object below. No slashes must
appear before the colon. Multiple back to back slashes are collapsed to one, as
`..` and `.` are applied accordingly. Local repositories must be absolute
paths and must begin with a `/`. Trailing `/` are removed.

@RESTBODYPARAM{config,object,optional,object}
Configuration of remote repository. This is required when an upload
operation is scheduled. In this case leave out the `uploadId`
attribute. See the description of the _arangobackup_ program in the manual
for a description of the `config` object.

@RESTBODYPARAM{uploadId,string,optional,string}
Upload ID to specify for which upload operation progress is queried or
the upload operation to abort.
If you specify this, leave out all the above body parameters.

@RESTBODYPARAM{abort,boolean,optional,}
Set this to `true` if a running upload operation should be aborted. In
this case, the only other body parameter which is needed is `uploadId`.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If all is well, code 200 is returned if progress is inquired or the
operation is aborted.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
If all is well, code 202 is returned if a new operation is scheduled.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the upload command is invoced with bad parameters or any HTTP
method other than `POST`, then an *HTTP 400* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{401}
If the authentication to the rempote repository fails, then an *HTTP
400* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If a backup corresponding to the identifier `id`  cannot be found, or if
there is no known upload operation with the given `uploadId`.

The result consists of a `list` object of hot backups by their `id`, where `id` uniquely identifies a specific hot backup, `version` depicts the version of ArangoDB, which was used to create any individual hot backup and `datetime` displays the time of creation of the hot backup. Further parameters are the size of the backup in bytes as `sizeInBytes`, the number of individual data files as `nrFiles`, the number of db servers at time of creation as `nrDBServers`, the number of backup parts, which are found on the currently reachable db servers as `nrPiecesPresent`. If the backup was created allowing inconsistences, it is so denoted as `potentiallyInconsistent`. The `available` boolean parameter is tightly connected to the backup to be present and ready to be restored on all db servers. It is `true` except, when the number of db servers currently reachable does not match to the number of db servers listed in the backup.
Should the backup be encrypted the sha256 hashes of the user secrets are published here. This will allow you to use the correct
user secret for the encryption-at-rest feature to be able to restore the backup.

@brief creates a local backup

@RESTHEADER{POST /_admin/backup/create, Create backup}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Creates a consistent backup "as soon as possible", very much
like a snapshot in time, with a given label. The ambiguity in the
phrase "as soon as possible" refers to the next window during which a
global write lock across all databases can be obtained in order to
guarantee consistency. Note that the backup at first resides on the
same machine and hard drive as the original data. Make sure to upload
it to a remote site for an actual backup.

@RESTBODYPARAM{label,string,optional,string}
The label for this backup. The label is used together with a
timestamp string create a unique backup identifier, `<timestamp>_<label>`.
If no label is specified, the empty string is assumed and a default
UUID is created for this part of the ID.

@RESTBODYPARAM{timeout,number,optional,double}
The time in seconds that the operation tries to get a consistent
snapshot. The default is 120 seconds.

@RESTBODYPARAM{allowInconsistent,boolean,optional,}
If this flag is set to `true` and no global transaction lock can be
acquired within the given timeout, a possibly inconsistent backup
is taken. The default for this flag is `false` and in this case
a timeout results in an HTTP 408 error.

@RESTBODYPARAM{force,boolean,optional,}
If this flag is set to `true` and no global transaction lock can be acquired
within the given timeout, all running transactions are forcefully aborted to
ensure that a consistent backup can be created. This does not include 
JavaScript transactions. It waits for the transactions to be aborted at most 
`timeout` seconds. Thus using `force` the request timeout is doubled.
To abort transactions is almost certainly not what you want for your application. 
In the presence of intermediate commits it can even destroy the atomicity of your
transactions. Use at your own risk, and only if you need a consistent backup at 
all costs. The default and recommended value is `false`. If both 
`allowInconsistent` and `force` are set to `true`, then the latter takes 
precedence and transactions are aborted. This is only available in the cluster.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
If all is well, code 201 is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the create command is invoked with bad parameters or any HTTP
method other than `POST`, then an *HTTP 400* is returned. The specifics
are detailed in the returned error document.

@RESTRETURNCODE{408}
If the operation cannot obtain a global transaction lock
within the timeout, then an *HTTP 408* is returned.

The result `body` contains besides the above discussed error codes the `result` object, if `code` is equal to `201`, which holds the unique identifier of this hot backup as the string attibute `id`, the full size in bytes as `sizeInBytes`, the number of idividual files as `nrFiles` and the number of database servers as `nrDBServers`. Single server deployments list potentially misleadingly `nrDBServers: 1`. Furthermore, the body contains a `datetime` time stamp and the flag `potentiallyInconsistent`, which indicates that the backup could inconsistent. This only happens if `allowInconsistent` has happened.

@startDocuBlock batch_processing

@brief executes a batch request

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/batch,executes a batch request, RestBatchHandler} TODOSWAGGER: contentype

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{body,string,required}
The multipart batch request, consisting of the envelope and the individual
batch parts.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Executes a batch request. A batch request can contain any number of
other requests that can be sent to ArangoDB in isolation. The benefit of
using batch requests is that batching requests requires less client/server
roundtrips than when sending isolated requests.

All parts of a batch request are executed serially on the server. The
server will return the results of all parts in a single response when all
parts are finished.

Technically, a batch request is a multipart HTTP request, with
content-type `multipart/form-data`. A batch request consists of an
envelope and the individual batch part actions. Batch part actions
are "regular" HTTP requests, including full header and an optional body.
Multiple batch parts are separated by a boundary identifier. The
boundary identifier is declared in the batch envelope. The MIME content-type
for each individual batch part must be `application/x-arango-batchpart`.

Please note that when constructing the individual batch parts, you must
use CRLF (`\r\n`) as the line terminator as in regular HTTP messages.

The response sent by the server will be an `HTTP 200` response, with an
optional error summary header `x-arango-errors`. This header contains the
number of batch part operations that failed with an HTTP error code of at
least 400. This header is only present in the response if the number of
errors is greater than zero.

The response sent by the server is a multipart response, too. It contains
the individual HTTP responses for all batch parts, including the full HTTP
result header (with status code and other potential headers) and an
optional result body. The individual batch parts in the result are
seperated using the same boundary value as specified in the request.

The order of batch parts in the response will be the same as in the
original client request. Client can additionally use the `Content-Id`
MIME header in a batch part to define an individual id for each batch part.
The server will return this id is the batch part responses, too.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the batch was received successfully. HTTP 200 is returned
even if one or multiple batch part actions failed.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the batch envelope is malformed or incorrectly formatted.
This code will also be returned if the content-type of the overall batch
request or the individual MIME parts is not as expected.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.

@EXAMPLES

Sending a batch request with five batch parts:

- GET /_api/version

- DELETE /_api/collection/products

- POST /_api/collection/products

- GET /_api/collection/products/figures

- DELETE /_api/collection/products

The boundary (`SomeBoundaryValue`) is passed to the server in the HTTP
`Content-Type` HTTP header.

@startDocuBlock import_json

@brief imports documents from JSON

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/import#json,imports documents from JSON, RestImportHandler}

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{documents,string,required}
The body must either be a JSON-encoded array of objects or a string with
multiple JSON objects separated by newlines.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{type,string,required}
Determines how the body of the request will be interpreted. `type` can have
the following values:
- `documents`: when this type is used, each line in the request body is
  expected to be an individual JSON-encoded document. Multiple JSON objects
  in the request body need to be separated by newlines.
- `list`: when this type is used, the request body must contain a single
  JSON-encoded array of individual objects to import.
- `auto`: if set, this will automatically determine the body type (either
  `documents` or `list`).

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The collection name.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{fromPrefix,string,optional}
An optional prefix for the values in `_from` attributes. If specified, the
value is automatically prepended to each `_from` input value. This allows
specifying just the keys for `_from`.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{toPrefix,string,optional}
An optional prefix for the values in `_to` attributes. If specified, the
value is automatically prepended to each `_to` input value. This allows
specifying just the keys for `_to`.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{overwrite,boolean,optional}
If this parameter has a value of `true` or `yes`, then all data in the
collection will be removed prior to the import. Note that any existing
index definitions will be preserved.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Wait until documents have been synced to disk before returning.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{onDuplicate,string,optional}
Controls what action is carried out in case of a unique key constraint
violation. Possible values are:<br>
- *error*: this will not import the current document because of the unique
  key constraint violation. This is the default setting.
- *update*: this will update an existing document in the database with the
  data specified in the request. Attributes of the existing document that
  are not present in the request will be preserved.
- *replace*: this will replace an existing document in the database with the
  data specified in the request.
- *ignore*: this will not update an existing document and simply ignore the
  error caused by a unique key constraint violation.<br>
Note that that *update*, *replace* and *ignore* will only work when the
import document in the request contains the *_key* attribute. *update* and
*replace* may also fail because of secondary unique key constraint violations.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{complete,boolean,optional}
If set to `true` or `yes`, it will make the whole import fail if any error
occurs. Otherwise the import will continue even if some documents cannot
be imported.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{details,boolean,optional}
If set to `true` or `yes`, the result will include an attribute `details`
with details about documents that could not be imported.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Creates documents in the collection identified by `collection-name`.
The JSON representations of the documents must be passed as the body of the
POST request. The request body can either consist of multiple lines, with
each line being a single stand-alone JSON object, or a singe JSON array with
sub-objects.

The response is a JSON object with the following attributes:

- `created`: number of documents imported.

- `errors`: number of documents that were not imported due to an error.

- `empty`: number of empty lines found in the input (will only contain a
  value greater zero for types `documents` or `auto`).

- `updated`: number of updated/replaced documents (in case `onDuplicate`
  was set to either `update` or `replace`).

- `ignored`: number of failed but ignored insert operations (in case
  `onDuplicate` was set to `ignore`).

- `details`: if query parameter `details` is set to true, the result will
  contain a `details` attribute which is an array with more detailed
  information about which documents could not be inserted.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if all documents could be imported successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if `type` contains an invalid value, no `collection` is
specified, the documents are incorrectly encoded, or the request
is malformed.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if `collection` or the `_from` or `_to` attributes of an
imported edge refer to an unknown collection.

@RESTRETURNCODE{409}
is returned if the import would trigger a unique key violation and
`complete` is set to `true`.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
is returned if the server cannot auto-generate a document key (out of keys
error) for a document with no user-defined key.

@endDocuBlock


<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/Rest/Bulk/import_document.md -->
@startDocuBlock import_document

@brief imports documents from JSON-encoded lists

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/import#document,imports document values, RestImportHandler#document}

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{documents,string,required}
The body must consist of JSON-encoded arrays of attribute values, with one
line per document. The first row of the request must be a JSON-encoded
array of attribute names. These attribute names are used for the data in the
subsequent lines.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The collection name.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{fromPrefix,string,optional}
An optional prefix for the values in `_from` attributes. If specified, the
value is automatically prepended to each `_from` input value. This allows
specifying just the keys for `_from`.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{toPrefix,string,optional}
An optional prefix for the values in `_to` attributes. If specified, the
value is automatically prepended to each `_to` input value. This allows
specifying just the keys for `_to`.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{overwrite,boolean,optional}
If this parameter has a value of `true` or `yes`, then all data in the
collection will be removed prior to the import. Note that any existing
index definitions will be preserved.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Wait until documents have been synced to disk before returning.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{onDuplicate,string,optional}
Controls what action is carried out in case of a unique key constraint
violation. Possible values are:<br>
- *error*: this will not import the current document because of the unique
  key constraint violation. This is the default setting.
- *update*: this will update an existing document in the database with the
  data specified in the request. Attributes of the existing document that
  are not present in the request will be preserved.
- *replace*: this will replace an existing document in the database with the
  data specified in the request.
- *ignore*: this will not update an existing document and simply ignore the
  error caused by the unique key constraint violation.<br>
Note that *update*, *replace* and *ignore* will only work when the
import document in the request contains the *_key* attribute. *update* and
*replace* may also fail because of secondary unique key constraint
violations.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{complete,boolean,optional}
If set to `true` or `yes`, it will make the whole import fail if any error
occurs. Otherwise the import will continue even if some documents cannot
be imported.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{details,boolean,optional}
If set to `true` or `yes`, the result will include an attribute `details`
with details about documents that could not be imported.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Creates documents in the collection identified by `collection-name`.
The first line of the request body must contain a JSON-encoded array of
attribute names. All following lines in the request body must contain
JSON-encoded arrays of attribute values. Each line is interpreted as a
separate document, and the values specified will be mapped to the array
of attribute names specified in the first header line.

The response is a JSON object with the following attributes:

- `created`: number of documents imported.

- `errors`: number of documents that were not imported due to an error.

- `empty`: number of empty lines found in the input (will only contain a
  value greater zero for types `documents` or `auto`).

- `updated`: number of updated/replaced documents (in case `onDuplicate`
  was set to either `update` or `replace`).

- `ignored`: number of failed but ignored insert operations (in case
  `onDuplicate` was set to `ignore`).

- `details`: if query parameter `details` is set to true, the result will
  contain a `details` attribute which is an array with more detailed
  information about which documents could not be inserted.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if all documents could be imported successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if `type` contains an invalid value, no `collection` is
specified, the documents are incorrectly encoded, or the request
is malformed.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if `collection` or the `_from` or `_to` attributes of an
imported edge refer to an unknown collection.

@RESTRETURNCODE{409}
is returned if the import would trigger a unique key violation and
`complete` is set to `true`.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
is returned if the server cannot auto-generate a document key (out of keys
error) for a document with no user-defined key.

@brief Retrieve JWT secrets info

@RESTHEADER{GET /_admin/server/jwt, Fetch information about the currently loaded secrets, handleJWT:get}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Get information about the currently loaded secrets.

To utilize the API a superuser JWT token is necessary, otherwise the response
will be _HTTP 403 Forbidden_.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
boolean flag to indicate whether an error occurred (*false* in this case)

@RESTREPLYBODY{code,integer,required,int64}
the HTTP status code - 200 in this case

@RESTREPLYBODY{result,object,required,jwt_secret_struct}
The result object.

@RESTSTRUCT{active,jwt_secret_struct,object,required,}
An object with the SHA-256 hash of the active secret.

@RESTSTRUCT{passive,jwt_secret_struct,array,required,object}
An array of objects with the SHA-256 hashes of the passive secrets.
Can be empty.

@brief Return whether or not a server is available

@RESTHEADER{GET /_admin/server/availability, Return whether or not a server is available, handleAvailability}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Return availability information about a server.

This is a public API so it does *not* require authentication. It is meant to be
used only in the context of server monitoring.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
This API will return HTTP 200 in case the server is up and running and usable for
arbitrary operations, is not set to read-only mode and is currently not a follower
in case of an active failover setup.

@RESTRETURNCODE{503}
HTTP 503 will be returned in case the server is during startup or during shutdown,
is set to read-only mode or is currently a follower in an active failover setup.

In addition, HTTP 503 will be returned in case the fill grade of the scheduler
queue exceeds the configured high-water mark (adjustable via startup option
`--server.unavailability-queue-fill-grade`), which by default is set to 75 % of
the maximum queue length.

@startDocuBlock get_admin_metrics

@brief return the current instance metrics

@RESTHEADER{GET /_admin/metrics, Read the metrics, getMetrics}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{serverId,string,optional}
Returns metrics of the specified server. If no serverId is given, the asked 
server will reply. This parameter is only meaningful on Coordinators.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the instance's current metrics in Prometheus format. The
returned document collects all instance metrics, which are measured
at any given time and exposes them for collection by Prometheus.

The document contains different metrics and metrics groups dependent
on the role of the queried instance. All exported metrics are
published with the `arangodb_` or `rocksdb_` string to distinguish
them from other collected data. 

The API then needs to be added to the Prometheus configuration file
for collection.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
Metrics were returned successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
The metrics API may be disabled using `--server.export-metrics-api false`
setting in the server. In this case, the result of the call indicates the API
to be not found.

@startDocuBlock post_admin_execute

@brief Execute a script on the server.

@RESTHEADER{POST /_admin/execute, Execute program, RestAdminExecuteHandler}

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{body,string,required}
The body to be executed.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Executes the javascript code in the body on the server as the body
of a function with no arguments. If you have a *return* statement
then the return value you produce will be returned as content type
*application/json*. If the parameter *returnAsJSON* is set to
*true*, the result will be a JSON object describing the return value
directly, otherwise a string produced by JSON.stringify will be
returned.

Note that this API endpoint will only be present if the server was
started with the option `--javascript.allow-admin-execute true`.

The default value of this option is `false`, which disables the execution of
user-defined code and disables this API endpoint entirely.
This is also the recommended setting for production.

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned when everything went well, or if a timeout occurred. In the
latter case a body of type application/json indicating the timeout
is returned. depending on *returnAsJSON* this is a json object or a plain string.

@RESTRETURNCODE{403}
is returned if ArangoDB is not running in cluster mode.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if ArangoDB was not compiled for cluster operation.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Return mode information about a server. The json response will contain
a field `mode` with the value `readonly` or `default`. In a read-only server
all write operations will fail with an error code of `1004` (_ERROR_READ_ONLY_).
Creating or dropping of databases and collections will also fail with error code `11` (_ERROR_FORBIDDEN_).

@startDocuBlock delete_api_shutdown

@brief initiates the shutdown sequence

@RESTHEADER{DELETE /_admin/shutdown, Initiate shutdown sequence, RestShutdownHandler}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{soft,boolean,optional}
<small>Introduced in: v3.7.12, v3.8.1, v3.9.0</small>

If set to `true`, this initiates a soft shutdown. This is only available
on Coordinators. When issued, the Coordinator tracks a number of ongoing
operations, waits until all have finished, and then shuts itself down
normally. In the meantime, new operations of these types are no longer
accepted and a 503 response is sent instead. However, further requests
to finish the ongoing operations are allowed. This feature can be used
to make restart operations of Coordinators less intrusive for clients.

The following types of operations are tracked:

 - AQL cursors (in particular streaming cursors)
 - Transactions (in particular stream transactions)
 - Pregel runs (conducted by this Coordinator)
 - Ongoing asynchronous requests (using the `x-arango-async: store` HTTP header
 - Finished asynchronous requests, whose result has not yet been
   collected
 - Queued low priority requests (most normal requests)
 - Ongoing low priority requests

Note that the latter two are tracked but not prevented from being
started, to allow for finishing operations.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
This call initiates a clean shutdown sequence. Requires administrive privileges.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned in all cases, `OK` will be returned in the result buffer on success.

@RESTHEADER{GET /_admin/shutdown, Query progress of soft shutdown process, RestGetShutdownHandler}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
<small>Introduced in: v3.7.12, v3.8.1, v3.9.0</small>

This call reports progress about a soft Coordinator shutdown (see
documentation of `DELETE /_admin/shutdown?soft=true`).
In this case, the following types of operations are tracked:

 - AQL cursors (in particular streaming cursors)
 - Transactions (in particular stream transactions)
 - Pregel runs (conducted by this Coordinator)
 - Ongoing asynchronous requests (using the `x-arango-async: store` HTTP header
 - Finished asynchronous requests, whose result has not yet been
   collected
 - Queued low priority requests (most normal requests)
 - Ongoing low priority requests

This API is only available on Coordinators.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
The response indicates the fact that a soft shutdown is ongoing and the
number of active operations of the various types. Once all numbers have gone
to 0, the flag `allClear` is set and the Coordinator shuts down automatically.

@brief Hot-reload JWT secrets

@RESTHEADER{POST /_admin/server/jwt, Hot-reload the JWT secret(s) from disk, handleJWT:post}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Sending a request without payload to this endpoint reloads the JWT secret(s)
from disk. Only the files specified via the arangod startup option
`--server.jwt-secret-keyfile` or `--server.jwt-secret-folder` are used.
It is not possible to change the locations where files are loaded from
without restarting the process.

To utilize the API a superuser JWT token is necessary, otherwise the response
will be _HTTP 403 Forbidden_.

@startDocuBlock get_admin_statistics

@brief return the statistics information

@RESTHEADER{GET /_admin/statistics, Read the statistics, getStatistics}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
This endpoint should no longer be used. It is deprecated from version 3.8.0 on.
Use `/_admin/metrics/v2` instead, which provides the data exposed by this API
and a lot more.
{% endhint %}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the statistics information. The returned object contains the
statistics figures grouped together according to the description returned by
*_admin/statistics-description*. For instance, to access a figure *userTime*
from the group *system*, you first select the sub-object describing the
group stored in *system* and in that sub-object the value for *userTime* is
stored in the attribute of the same name.

In case of a distribution, the returned object contains the total count in
*count* and the distribution list in *counts*. The sum (or total) of the
individual values is returned in *sum*.

The transaction statistics show the local started, committed and aborted
transactions as well as intermediate commits done for the server queried. The
intermediate commit count will only take non zero values for the RocksDB
storage engine. Coordinators do almost no local transactions themselves in
their local databases, therefor cluster transactions (transactions started on a
Coordinator that require DB-Servers to finish before the transactions is
committed cluster wide) are just added to their local statistics. This means
that the statistics you would see for a single server is roughly what you can
expect in a cluster setup using a single Coordinator querying this Coordinator.
Just with the difference that cluster transactions have no notion of
intermediate commits and will not increase the value.

@startDocuBlock get_admin_server_id

@brief Get to know the internal id of the server

@RESTHEADER{GET /_admin/server/id, Return id of a server in a cluster, handleId}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the id of a server in a cluster. The request will fail if the
server is not running in cluster mode.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
Is returned when the server is running in cluster mode.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
Is returned when the server is not running in cluster mode.
@endDocuBlock


<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/Rest/Administration/put_admin_server_mode.md -->
@startDocuBlock put_admin_server_mode

@brief Update the mode of this server (read-only or default)

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_admin/server/mode, Update whether or not a server is in read-only mode, handleMode:set}

@RESTBODYPARAM{mode,string,required,string}
The mode of the server `readonly` or `default`.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Update mode information about a server. The json response will contain
a field `mode` with the value `readonly` or `default`. In a read-only server
all write operations will fail with an error code of `1004` (_ERROR_READ_ONLY_).
Creating or dropping of databases and collections will also fail with error
code `11` (_ERROR_FORBIDDEN_).

This is a protected API. It requires authentication and administrative
server rights.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
This API will return HTTP 200 if everything is ok

@RESTRETURNCODE{401}
if the request was not authenticated as a user with sufficient rights

@endDocuBlock


<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/Rest/Administration/get_admin_metrics_v2.md -->
@startDocuBlock get_admin_metrics_v2

@brief return the current instance metrics

@RESTHEADER{GET /_admin/metrics/v2, Read the metrics, getMetricsV2}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{serverId,string,optional}
Returns metrics of the specified server. If no serverId is given, the asked
server will reply. This parameter is only meaningful on Coordinators.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the instance's current metrics in Prometheus format. The
returned document collects all instance metrics, which are measured
at any given time and exposes them for collection by Prometheus.

The document contains different metrics and metrics groups dependent
on the role of the queried instance. All exported metrics are
published with the prefix `arangodb_` to distinguish them from other
collected data.

The API then needs to be added to the Prometheus configuration file
for collection.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
Metrics were returned successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
The metrics API may be disabled using `--server.export-metrics-api false`
setting in the server. In this case, the result of the call indicates the API
to be not found.

@startDocuBlock get_admin_server_tls

@brief Return the TLS data of this server (server key, client-auth CA)

@RESTHEADER{GET /_admin/server/tls, Return a summary of the TLS data, handleMode:get}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Return a summary of the TLS data. The JSON response will contain a field
`result` with the following components:

  - `keyfile`: Information about the key file.
  - `clientCA`: Information about the CA for client certificate
    verification.

If server name indication (SNI) is used and multiple key files are
configured for different server names, then there is an additional
attribute `SNI`, which contains for each configured server name
the corresponding information about the key file for that server name.

In all cases the value of the attribute will be a JSON object, which
has a subset of the following attributes (whatever is appropriate):

  - `sha256`: The value is a string with the SHA256 of the whole input
    file.
  - `certificates`: The value is a JSON array with the public
    certificates in the chain in the file.
  - `privateKeySha256`: In cases where there is a private key (`keyfile`
    but not `clientCA`), this field is present and contains a
    JSON string with the SHA256 of the private key.

This is a public API so it does *not* require authentication.

This API will return HTTP 200 if everything is ok

array of objects, which each have the attribute `endpoint`, whose value
is a string with the endpoint description. There is an entry for each
Coordinator in the cluster. This method only works on Coordinators in
cluster mode. In case of an error the `error` attribute is set to
`true`.

attribute if the transaction committed successfully.

@RESTBODYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional,}
an optional boolean flag that, if set, will force the
transaction to write all data to disk before returning.

@RESTBODYPARAM{allowImplicit,boolean,optional,}
Allow reading from undeclared collections.

@RESTBODYPARAM{lockTimeout,integer,optional,int64}
an optional numeric value that can be used to set a
timeout for waiting on collection locks. If not specified, a default
value will be used. Setting *lockTimeout* to *0* will make ArangoDB
not time out waiting for a lock.

@RESTBODYPARAM{params,string,optional,string}
optional arguments passed to *action*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{maxTransactionSize,integer,optional,int64}
Transaction size limit in bytes. Honored by the RocksDB storage engine only.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
The transaction description must be passed in the body of the POST request.

If the transaction is fully executed and committed on the server,
*HTTP 200* will be returned. Additionally, the return value of the
code defined in *action* will be returned in the *result* attribute.

For successfully committed transactions, the returned JSON object has the
following properties:

- *error*: boolean flag to indicate if an error occurred (*false*
  in this case)

- *code*: the HTTP status code

- *result*: the return value of the transaction

If the transaction specification is either missing or malformed, the server
will respond with *HTTP 400*.

The body of the response will then contain a JSON object with additional error
details. The object has the following attributes:

- *error*: boolean flag to indicate that an error occurred (*true* in this case)

- *code*: the HTTP status code

- *errorNum*: the server error number

- *errorMessage*: a descriptive error message

If a transaction fails to commit, either by an exception thrown in the
*action* code, or by an internal error, the server will respond with
an error.
Any other errors will be returned with any of the return codes
*HTTP 400*, *HTTP 409*, or *HTTP 500*.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the transaction is fully executed and committed on the server,
*HTTP 200* will be returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the transaction specification is either missing or malformed, the server
will respond with *HTTP 400*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the transaction specification contains an unknown collection, the server
will respond with *HTTP 404*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
Exceptions thrown by users will make the server respond with a return code of
*HTTP 500*

@startDocuBlock get_api_database_new

@brief creates a new database

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/database, Create database, createDatabase}

@RESTBODYPARAM{name,string,required,string}
Has to contain a valid database name.

@RESTBODYPARAM{options,object,optional,get_api_database_new_OPTIONS}
Optional object which can contain the following attributes:

@RESTSTRUCT{sharding,get_api_database_new_OPTIONS,string,optional,}
The sharding method to use for new collections in this database. Valid values
are: "", "flexible", or "single". The first two are equivalent. _(cluster only)_

@RESTSTRUCT{replicationFactor,get_api_database_new_OPTIONS,integer,optional,}
Default replication factor for new collections created in this database.
Special values include "satellite", which will replicate the collection to
every DB-Server (Enterprise Edition only), and 1, which disables replication.
_(cluster only)_

@RESTSTRUCT{writeConcern,get_api_database_new_OPTIONS,number,optional,}
Default write concern for new collections created in this database.
It determines how many copies of each shard are required to be
in sync on the different DB-Servers. If there are less then these many copies
in the cluster a shard will refuse to write. Writes to shards with enough
up-to-date copies will succeed at the same time however. The value of
*writeConcern* can not be larger than *replicationFactor*. _(cluster only)_

@RESTBODYPARAM{users,array,optional,get_api_database_new_USERS}
Has to be an array of user objects to initially create for the new database.
User information will not be changed for users that already exist.
If *users* is not specified or does not contain any users, a default user
*root* will be created with an empty string password. This ensures that the
new database will be accessible after it is created.
Each user object can contain the following attributes:

@RESTSTRUCT{username,get_api_database_new_USERS,string,required,}
Login name of the user to be created.

@RESTSTRUCT{passwd,get_api_database_new_USERS,string,optional,password}
The user password as a string. If not specified, it will default to an empty string.

@RESTSTRUCT{active,get_api_database_new_USERS,boolean,optional,}
A flag indicating whether the user account should be activated or not.
The default value is *true*. If set to *false*, the user won't be able to
log into the database. The default is *true*.

@RESTSTRUCT{extra,get_api_database_new_USERS,object,optional,}
A JSON object with extra user information. It is used by the web interface
to store graph viewer settings and saved queries. Should not be set or
modified by end users, as custom attributes will not be preserved.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Creates a new database

The response is a JSON object with the attribute *result* set to *true*.

**Note**: creating a new database is only possible from within the *_system* database.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the database was created successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the request parameters are invalid or if a database with the
specified name already exists.

@RESTRETURNCODE{403}
is returned if the request was not executed in the *_system* database.

@RESTRETURNCODE{409}
is returned if a database with the specified name already exists.

@EXAMPLES

Creating a database named *example*.

@startDocuBlock job_fetch_result

@brief fetches a job result and removes it from the queue

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/job/{job-id}, Return result of an async job, getJobResult}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{job-id,string,required}
The async job id.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the result of an async job identified by job-id. If the async job
result is present on the server, the result will be removed from the list of
result. That means this method can be called for each job-id once.
The method will return the original job result's headers and body, plus the
additional HTTP header x-arango-async-job-id. If this header is present,
then
the job was found and the response contains the original job's result. If
the header is not present, the job was not found and the response contains
status information from the job manager.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{204}
is returned if the job requested via job-id is still in the queue of pending
(or not yet finished) jobs. In this case, no x-arango-async-id HTTP header
will be returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if no job-id was specified in the request. In this case,
no x-arango-async-id HTTP header will be returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the job was not found or already deleted or fetched from
the job result list. In this case, no x-arango-async-id HTTP header will
be returned.

@EXAMPLES

@startDocuBlock job_delete

@brief deletes an async job result

@RESTHEADER{DELETE /_api/job/{type}#by-type, Deletes async job, deleteJob:byType}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{type,string,required}
The type of jobs to delete. type can be:
* *all*: Deletes all jobs results. Currently executing or queued async
  jobs will not be stopped by this call.
* *expired*: Deletes expired results. To determine the expiration status of a
  result, pass the stamp query parameter. stamp needs to be a UNIX timestamp,
  and all async job results created at a lower timestamp will be deleted.
* *an actual job-id*: In this case, the call will remove the result of the
  specified async job. If the job is currently executing or queued, it will
  not be aborted.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{stamp,number,optional}
A UNIX timestamp specifying the expiration threshold when type is expired.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Deletes either all job results, expired job results, or the result of a
specific job.
Clients can use this method to perform an eventual garbage collection of job
results.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the deletion operation was carried out successfully.
This code will also be returned if no results were deleted.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if type is not specified or has an invalid value.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if type is a job-id but no async job with the specified id was
found.

@startDocuBlock put_api_collection_load

@brief loads a collection

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/collection/{collection-name}/load, Load collection, handleCommandPut:loadCollection}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
The load function is deprecated from version 3.8.0 onwards and should no longer be used.
{% endhint %}

{% hint 'warning' %}
Accessing collections by their numeric ID is deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
You should reference them via their names instead.
{% endhint %}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection-name,string,required}
The name of the collection.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Loads a collection into memory. Returns the collection on success.

The request body object might optionally contain the following attribute:

- *count*: If set, this controls whether the return value should include
  the number of documents in the collection. Setting *count* to
  *false* may speed up loading a collection. The default value for
  *count* is *true*.

On success an object with the following attributes is returned:

- *id*: The identifier of the collection.

- *name*: The name of the collection.

- *count*: The number of documents inside the collection. This is only
  returned if the *count* input parameters is set to *true* or has
  not been specified.

- *status*: The status of the collection as number.

- *type*: The collection type. Valid types are:
  - 2: document collection
  - 3: edges collection

- *isSystem*: If *true* then the collection is a system collection.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the *collection-name* is missing, then a *HTTP 400* is
returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404*
is returned.

@startDocuBlock get_api_collection_figures

@brief Fetch the statistics of a collection

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/collection/{collection-name}/figures, Return statistics for a collection, handleCommandGet:collectionFigures}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
Accessing collections by their numeric ID is deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
You should reference them via their names instead.
{% endhint %}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection-name,string,required}
The name of the collection.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{details,boolean,optional}
Setting `details` to `true` will return extended storage engine-specific
details to the figures. The details are intended for debugging ArangoDB itself
and their format is subject to change. By default, `details` is set to `false`,
so no details are returned and the behavior is identical to previous versions
of ArangoDB.
Please note that requesting `details` may cause additional load and thus have
an impact on performace.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
In addition to the above, the result also contains the number of documents
and additional statistical information about the collection.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
Returns information about the collection:

@RESTREPLYBODY{count,integer,required,int64}
The number of documents currently present in the collection.

@RESTREPLYBODY{figures,object,required,collection_figures}
metrics of the collection

@RESTSTRUCT{indexes,collection_figures,object,required,collection_figures_indexes}

@RESTSTRUCT{count,collection_figures_indexes,integer,required,int64}
The total number of indexes defined for the collection, including the pre-defined
indexes (e.g. primary index).

@RESTSTRUCT{size,collection_figures_indexes,integer,required,int64}
The total memory allocated for indexes in bytes.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the *collection-name* is missing, then a *HTTP 400* is
returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404*
is returned.

@brief returns a checksum for the specified collection

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/collection/{collection-name}/checksum, Return checksum for the collection, handleCommandGet:collectionChecksum}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
Accessing collections by their numeric ID is deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
You should reference them via their names instead.
{% endhint %}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection-name,string,required}
The name of the collection.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{withRevisions,boolean,optional}
Whether or not to include document revision ids in the checksum calculation.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{withData,boolean,optional}
Whether or not to include document body data in the checksum calculation.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Will calculate a checksum of the meta-data (keys and optionally revision ids) and
optionally the document data in the collection.

The checksum can be used to compare if two collections on different ArangoDB
instances contain the same contents. The current revision of the collection is
returned too so one can make sure the checksums are calculated for the same
state of data.

By default, the checksum will only be calculated on the *_key* system attribute
of the documents contained in the collection. For edge collections, the system
attributes *_from* and *_to* will also be included in the calculation.

By setting the optional query parameter *withRevisions* to *true*, then revision
ids (*_rev* system attributes) are included in the checksumming.

By providing the optional query parameter *withData* with a value of *true*,
the user-defined document attributes will be included in the calculation too.
**Note**: Including user-defined attributes will make the checksumming slower.

The response is a JSON object with the following attributes:

- *checksum*: The calculated checksum as a number.

- *revision*: The collection revision id as a string.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the *collection-name* is missing, then a *HTTP 400* is

is returned.

@brief Load Indexes into Memory

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/collection/{collection-name}/loadIndexesIntoMemory, Load Indexes into Memory, handleCommandPut:loadIndexes}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
Accessing collections by their numeric ID is deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
You should reference them via their names instead.
{% endhint %}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection-name,string,required}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
This route tries to cache all index entries
of this collection into the main memory.
Therefore it iterates over all indexes of the collection
and stores the indexed values, not the entire document data,
in memory.
All lookups that could be found in the cache are much faster
than lookups not stored in the cache so you get a nice performance boost.
It is also guaranteed that the cache is consistent with the stored data.

For the time being this function is only useful on RocksDB storage engine,
as in MMFiles engine all indexes are in memory anyways.

On RocksDB this function honors all memory limits, if the indexes you want
to load are smaller than your memory limit this function guarantees that most
index values are cached.
If the index is larger than your memory limit this function will fill up values
up to this limit and for the time being there is no way to control which indexes
of the collection should have priority over others.

On sucess this function returns an object with attribute `result` set to `true`

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the indexes have all been loaded

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the *collection-name* is missing, then a *HTTP 400* is
returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404* is returned.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
If *true* then the data is synchronized to disk before returning from the
truncate operation (default: *false*)

@RESTQUERYPARAM{compact,boolean,optional}
If *true* (default) then the storage engine is told to start a compaction
in order to free up disk space. This can be resource intensive. If the only 
intention is to start over with an empty collection, specify *false*.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Removes all documents from the collection, but leaves the indexes intact.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the *collection-name* is missing, then a *HTTP 400* is
returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404*
is returned.

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/collection/{collection-name}/properties, Change properties of a collection, handleCommandPut:modifyProperties}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
Accessing collections by their numeric ID is deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
You should reference them via their names instead.
{% endhint %}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection-name,string,required}
The name of the collection.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Changes the properties of a collection. Expects an object with the
attribute(s)

- *waitForSync*: If *true* then creating or changing a
  document will wait until the data has been synchronized to disk.

- *schema*: Object that specifies the collection level schema 
  for documents. The attribute keys `rule`, `level` and `message` must follow
  the rules documented in [Document Schema Validation](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/document-schema-validation.html)

On success an object with the following attributes is returned:

- *id*: The identifier of the collection.

- *name*: The name of the collection.

- *waitForSync*: The new value.

- *status*: The status of the collection as number.

- *type*: The collection type. Valid types are:
  - 2: document collection
  - 3: edges collection

- *isSystem*: If *true* then the collection is a system collection.

- *keyOptions*: JSON object which contains key generation options:
  - *type*: specifies the type of the key generator. The currently
    available generators are *traditional*, *autoincrement*, *uuid*
    and *padded*.
  - *allowUserKeys*: if set to *true*, then it is allowed to supply
    own key values in the *_key* attribute of a document. If set to
    *false*, then the key generator is solely responsible for
    generating keys and supplying own key values in the *_key* attribute
    of documents is considered an error.

* *schema* (optional, default is *null*):
  Object that specifies the collection level schema for documents.
  The attribute keys `rule`, `level` and `message` must follow the rules
  documented in [Document Schema Validation](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/document-schema-validation.html)

**Note**: except for *waitForSync* and *name*, collection
properties **cannot be changed** once a collection is created. To rename
a collection, the rename endpoint must be used.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the *collection-name* is missing, then a *HTTP 400* is
returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404*

@startDocuBlock post_api_collection

@brief creates a collection

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/collection, Create collection, handleCommandPost:CreateCollection}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
Accessing collections by their numeric ID is deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
You should reference them via their names instead.
{% endhint %}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Creates a new collection with a given name. The request must contain an
object with the following attributes.

@RESTBODYPARAM{name,string,required,string}
The name of the collection.

@RESTBODYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional,}
If *true* then the data is synchronized to disk before returning from a
document create, update, replace or removal operation. (default: false)

@RESTBODYPARAM{isSystem,boolean,optional,}
If *true*, create a  system collection. In this case *collection-name*
should start with an underscore. End users should normally create non-system
collections only. API implementors may be required to create system
collections in very special occasions, but normally a regular collection will do.
(The default is *false*)

@RESTBODYPARAM{schema,object,optional,}
Optional object that specifies the collection level schema for
documents. The attribute keys `rule`, `level` and `message` must follow the
rules documented in [Document Schema Validation](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/document-schema-validation.html)

@RESTBODYPARAM{keyOptions,object,optional,post_api_collection_opts}
additional options for key generation. If specified, then *keyOptions*
should be a JSON object containing the following attributes:

@RESTSTRUCT{type,post_api_collection_opts,string,required,string}
specifies the type of the key generator. The currently available generators are
*traditional*, *autoincrement*, *uuid* and *padded*.<br>
The *traditional* key generator generates numerical keys in ascending order.<br>
The *autoincrement* key generator generates numerical keys in ascending order,
the initial offset and the spacing can be configured (**note**: *autoincrement* is currently only 
supported for non-sharded collections).<br>
The *padded* key generator generates keys of a fixed length (16 bytes) in
ascending lexicographical sort order. This is ideal for usage with the _RocksDB_
engine, which will slightly benefit keys that are inserted in lexicographically
ascending order. The key generator can be used in a single-server or cluster.
The *uuid* key generator generates universally unique 128 bit keys, which
are stored in hexadecimal human-readable format. This key generator can be used
in a single-server or cluster to generate "seemingly random" keys. The keys
produced by this key generator are not lexicographically sorted.

@RESTSTRUCT{allowUserKeys,post_api_collection_opts,boolean,required,}
if set to *true*, then it is allowed to supply own key values in the
*_key* attribute of a document. If set to *false*, then the key generator
will solely be responsible for generating keys and supplying own key values
in the *_key* attribute of documents is considered an error.

@RESTSTRUCT{increment,post_api_collection_opts,integer,required,int64}
increment value for *autoincrement* key generator. Not used for other key
generator types.

@RESTSTRUCT{offset,post_api_collection_opts,integer,required,int64}
Initial offset value for *autoincrement* key generator.
Not used for other key generator types.

@RESTBODYPARAM{type,integer,optional,int64}
(The default is *2*): the type of the collection to create.
The following values for *type* are valid:<br>
- *2*: document collection
- *3*: edge collection

@RESTBODYPARAM{numberOfShards,integer,optional,int64}
(The default is *1*): in a cluster, this value determines the
number of shards to create for the collection. In a single
server setup, this option is meaningless.

@RESTBODYPARAM{shardKeys,string,optional,string}
(The default is *[ "_key" ]*): in a cluster, this attribute determines
which document attributes are used to determine the target shard for documents.
Documents are sent to shards based on the values of their shard key attributes.
The values of all shard key attributes in a document are hashed,
and the hash value is used to determine the target shard.
**Note**: Values of shard key attributes cannot be changed once set.
  This option is meaningless in a single server setup.

@RESTBODYPARAM{replicationFactor,integer,optional,int64}
(The default is *1*): in a cluster, this attribute determines how many copies
of each shard are kept on different DB-Servers. The value 1 means that only one
copy (no synchronous replication) is kept. A value of k means that k-1 replicas
are kept. It can also be the string `"satellite"` for a SatelliteCollection,
where the replication factor is matched to the number of DB-Servers
(Enterprise Edition only).

Any two copies reside on different DB-Servers. Replication between them is
synchronous, that is, every write operation to the "leader" copy will be replicated
to all "follower" replicas, before the write operation is reported successful.

If a server fails, this is detected automatically and one of the servers holding
copies take over, usually without an error being reported.

@RESTBODYPARAM{writeConcern,integer,optional,int64}
Write concern for this collection (default: 1).
It determines how many copies of each shard are required to be
in sync on the different DB-Servers. If there are less then these many copies
in the cluster a shard will refuse to write. Writes to shards with enough
up-to-date copies will succeed at the same time however. The value of
*writeConcern* can not be larger than *replicationFactor*. _(cluster only)_

@RESTBODYPARAM{distributeShardsLike,string,optional,string}
(The default is *""*): in an Enterprise Edition cluster, this attribute binds
the specifics of sharding for the newly created collection to follow that of a
specified existing collection.
**Note**: Using this parameter has consequences for the prototype
collection. It can no longer be dropped, before the sharding-imitating
collections are dropped. Equally, backups and restores of imitating
collections alone will generate warnings (which can be overridden)
about missing sharding prototype.

@RESTBODYPARAM{shardingStrategy,string,optional,string}
This attribute specifies the name of the sharding strategy to use for
the collection. Since ArangoDB 3.4 there are different sharding strategies
to select from when creating a new collection. The selected *shardingStrategy*
value will remain fixed for the collection and cannot be changed afterwards.
This is important to make the collection keep its sharding settings and
always find documents already distributed to shards using the same
initial sharding algorithm.

The available sharding strategies are:
- `community-compat`: default sharding used by ArangoDB
  Community Edition before version 3.4
- `enterprise-compat`: default sharding used by ArangoDB
  Enterprise Edition before version 3.4
- `enterprise-smart-edge-compat`: default sharding used by smart edge
  collections in ArangoDB Enterprise Edition before version 3.4
- `hash`: default sharding used for new collections starting from version 3.4
  (excluding smart edge collections)
- `enterprise-hash-smart-edge`: default sharding used for new
  smart edge collections starting from version 3.4

If no sharding strategy is specified, the default will be *hash* for
all collections, and *enterprise-hash-smart-edge* for all smart edge
collections (requires the *Enterprise Edition* of ArangoDB).
Manually overriding the sharding strategy does not yet provide a
benefit, but it may later in case other sharding strategies are added.

@RESTBODYPARAM{smartJoinAttribute,string,optional,string}
In an *Enterprise Edition* cluster, this attribute determines an attribute
of the collection that must contain the shard key value of the referred-to
SmartJoin collection. Additionally, the shard key for a document in this
collection must contain the value of this attribute, followed by a colon,
followed by the actual primary key of the document.

This feature can only be used in the *Enterprise Edition* and requires the
*distributeShardsLike* attribute of the collection to be set to the name
of another collection. It also requires the *shardKeys* attribute of the
collection to be set to a single shard key attribute, with an additional ':'
at the end.
A further restriction is that whenever documents are stored or updated in the
collection, the value stored in the *smartJoinAttribute* must be a string.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSyncReplication,integer,optional}
Default is *1* which means the server will only report success back to the
client if all replicas have created the collection. Set to *0* if you want
faster server responses and don't care about full replication.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{enforceReplicationFactor,integer,optional}
Default is *1* which means the server will check if there are enough replicas
available at creation time and bail out otherwise. Set to *0* to disable
this extra check.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the *collection-name* is missing, then a *HTTP 400* is
returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404* is returned.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the global AQL query results cache configuration. The configuration is a
JSON object with the following properties:

- *mode*: the mode the AQL query results cache operates in. The mode is one of the following
  values: *off*, *on* or *demand*.

- *maxResults*: the maximum number of query results that will be stored per database-specific
  cache.

- *maxResultsSize*: the maximum cumulated size of query results that will be stored per
  database-specific cache.

- *maxEntrySize*: the maximum individual result size of queries that will be stored per
  database-specific cache.

- *includeSystem*: whether or not results of queries that involve system collections will be
  stored in the query results cache.

@brief returns the configuration for the AQL query tracking

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/query/properties, Returns the properties for the AQL query tracking, readQueryProperties}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the current query tracking configuration. The configuration is a
JSON object with the following properties:

- *enabled*: if set to *true*, then queries will be tracked. If set to
  *false*, neither queries nor slow queries will be tracked.

- *trackSlowQueries*: if set to *true*, then slow queries will be tracked
  in the list of slow queries if their runtime exceeds the value set in
  *slowQueryThreshold*. In order for slow queries to be tracked, the *enabled*
  property must also be set to *true*.

- *trackBindVars*: if set to *true*, then bind variables used in queries will
  be tracked.

- *maxSlowQueries*: the maximum number of slow queries to keep in the list
  of slow queries. If the list of slow queries is full, the oldest entry in
  it will be discarded when additional slow queries occur.

- *slowQueryThreshold*: the threshold value for treating a query as slow. A
  query with a runtime greater or equal to this threshold value will be
  put into the list of slow queries when slow query tracking is enabled.
  The value for *slowQueryThreshold* is specified in seconds.

- *maxQueryStringLength*: the maximum query string length to keep in the
  list of queries. Query strings can have arbitrary lengths, and this property
  can be used to save memory in case very long query strings are used. The
  value is specified in bytes.

@startDocuBlock GetApiQuerySlow

@brief returns a list of slow running AQL queries

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/query/slow, Returns the list of slow AQL queries, readQuery:Slow}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns an array containing the last AQL queries that are finished and
have exceeded the slow query threshold in the selected database.
The maximum amount of queries in the list can be controlled by setting
the query tracking property `maxSlowQueries`. The threshold for treating
a query as *slow* can be adjusted by setting the query tracking property
`slowQueryThreshold`.

Each query is a JSON object with the following attributes:

- *id*: the query's id

- *database*: the name of the database the query runs in

- *user*: the name of the user that started the query

- *query*: the query string (potentially truncated)

- *bindVars*: the bind parameter values used by the query

- *started*: the date and time when the query was started

- *runTime*: the query's total run time

- *state*: the query's current execution state (will always be "finished"
  for the list of slow queries)

- *stream*: whether or not the query uses a streaming cursor

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{all,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, will return the slow queries from all databases, not just
the selected one.
Using the parameter is only allowed in the system database and with superuser
privileges.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
Is returned when the list of queries can be retrieved successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
The server will respond with *HTTP 400* in case of a malformed request,

@RESTRETURNCODE{403}
*HTTP 403* is returned in case the *all* parameter was used, but the request
was made in a different database than _system, or by an non-privileged user.

@startDocuBlock post_api_explain

@brief explain an AQL query and return information about it

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/explain, Explain an AQL query, explainQuery}

A JSON object describing the query and query parameters.

@RESTBODYPARAM{query,string,required,string}
the query which you want explained; If the query references any bind variables,
these must also be passed in the attribute *bindVars*. Additional
options for the query can be passed in the *options* attribute.

@RESTBODYPARAM{bindVars,array,optional,object}
key/value pairs representing the bind parameters.

@RESTBODYPARAM{options,object,optional,explain_options}
Options for the query

@RESTSTRUCT{allPlans,explain_options,boolean,optional,}
if set to *true*, all possible execution plans will be returned.
The default is *false*, meaning only the optimal plan will be returned.

@RESTSTRUCT{maxNumberOfPlans,explain_options,integer,optional,int64}
an optional maximum number of plans that the optimizer is
allowed to generate. Setting this attribute to a low value allows to put a
cap on the amount of work the optimizer does.

@RESTSTRUCT{optimizer,explain_options,object,optional,explain_options_optimizer}
Options related to the query optimizer.

@RESTSTRUCT{rules,explain_options_optimizer,array,optional,string}
A list of to-be-included or to-be-excluded optimizer rules can be put into this
attribute, telling the optimizer to include or exclude specific rules. To disable
a rule, prefix its name with a `-`, to enable a rule, prefix it with a `+`. There is
also a pseudo-rule `all`, which matches all optimizer rules. `-all` disables all rules.

@RESTDESCRIPTION

To explain how an AQL query would be executed on the server, the query string
can be sent to the server via an HTTP POST request. The server will then validate
the query and create an execution plan for it. The execution plan will be
returned, but the query will not be executed.

The execution plan that is returned by the server can be used to estimate the
probable performance of the query. Though the actual performance will depend
on many different factors, the execution plan normally can provide some rough
estimates on the amount of work the server needs to do in order to actually run
the query.

By default, the explain operation will return the optimal plan as chosen by
the query optimizer The optimal plan is the plan with the lowest total estimated
cost. The plan will be returned in the attribute *plan* of the response object.
If the option *allPlans* is specified in the request, the result will contain
all plans created by the optimizer. The plans will then be returned in the
attribute *plans*.

The result will also contain an attribute *warnings*, which is an array of
warnings that occurred during optimization or execution plan creation. Additionally,
a *stats* attribute is contained in the result with some optimizer statistics.
If *allPlans* is set to *false*, the result will contain an attribute *cacheable*
that states whether the query results can be cached on the server if the query
result cache were used. The *cacheable* attribute is not present when *allPlans*
is set to *true*.

Each plan in the result is a JSON object with the following attributes:
- *nodes*: the array of execution nodes of the plan.

- *estimatedCost*: the total estimated cost for the plan. If there are multiple
  plans, the optimizer will choose the plan with the lowest total cost.

- *collections*: an array of collections used in the query

- *rules*: an array of rules the optimizer applied.

- *variables*: array of variables used in the query (note: this may contain
  internal variables created by the optimizer)

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the query is valid, the server will respond with *HTTP 200* and
return the optimal execution plan in the *plan* attribute of the response.
If option *allPlans* was set in the request, an array of plans will be returned
in the *allPlans* attribute instead.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
The server will respond with *HTTP 400* in case of a malformed request,
or if the query contains a parse error. The body of the response will
contain the error details embedded in a JSON object.
Omitting bind variables if the query references any will also result
in an *HTTP 400* error.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
The server will respond with *HTTP 404* in case a non-existing collection is
accessed in the query.

The data returned in the **plan** attribute of the result contains one element per AQL top-level statement
(i.e. `FOR`, `RETURN`, `FILTER` etc.). If the query optimizer removed some unnecessary statements,
the result might also contain less elements than there were top-level statements in the AQL query.

The following example shows a query with a non-sensible filter condition that
the optimizer has removed so that there are less top-level statements.

@startDocuBlock PutApiQueryProperties

@brief changes the configuration for the AQL query tracking

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/query/properties, Changes the properties for the AQL query tracking, replaceProperties}

@RESTBODYPARAM{enabled,boolean,required,}
If set to *true*, then queries will be tracked. If set to
*false*, neither queries nor slow queries will be tracked.

@RESTBODYPARAM{trackSlowQueries,boolean,required,}
If set to *true*, then slow queries will be tracked
in the list of slow queries if their runtime exceeds the value set in
*slowQueryThreshold*. In order for slow queries to be tracked, the *enabled*
property must also be set to *true*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{trackBindVars,boolean,required,}
If set to *true*, then the bind variables used in queries will be tracked
along with queries.

@RESTBODYPARAM{maxSlowQueries,integer,required,int64}
The maximum number of slow queries to keep in the list
of slow queries. If the list of slow queries is full, the oldest entry in
it will be discarded when additional slow queries occur.

@RESTBODYPARAM{slowQueryThreshold,integer,required,int64}
The threshold value for treating a query as slow. A
query with a runtime greater or equal to this threshold value will be
put into the list of slow queries when slow query tracking is enabled.
The value for *slowQueryThreshold* is specified in seconds.

@RESTBODYPARAM{maxQueryStringLength,integer,required,int64}
The maximum query string length to keep in the list of queries.
Query strings can have arbitrary lengths, and this property
can be used to save memory in case very long query strings are used. The
value is specified in bytes.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
The properties need to be passed in the attribute *properties* in the body
of the HTTP request. *properties* needs to be a JSON object.

After the properties have been changed, the current set of properties will
be returned in the HTTP response.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
Is returned if the properties were changed successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
The server will respond with *HTTP 400* in case of a malformed request,

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
The server will respond with *HTTP 200* when the cache was cleared
successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
The server will respond with *HTTP 400* in case of a malformed request.

@startDocuBlock PostApiQueryProperties

@brief parse an AQL query and return information about it

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/query, Parse an AQL query, parseQuery}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
This endpoint is for query validation only. To actually query the database,
see `/api/cursor`.

@RESTBODYPARAM{query,string,required,string}
To validate a query string without executing it, the query string can be
passed to the server via an HTTP POST request.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the query is valid, the server will respond with *HTTP 200* and
return the names of the bind parameters it found in the query (if any) in
the *bindVars* attribute of the response. It will also return an array
of the collections used in the query in the *collections* attribute.
If a query can be parsed successfully, the *ast* attribute of the returned
JSON will contain the abstract syntax tree representation of the query.
The format of the *ast* is subject to change in future versions of
ArangoDB, but it can be used to inspect how ArangoDB interprets a given
query. Note that the abstract syntax tree will be returned without any
optimizations applied to it.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
The server will respond with *HTTP 400* in case of a malformed request,
or if the query contains a parse error. The body of the response will
contain the error details embedded in a JSON object.

@startDocuBlock api_foxx_service_upgrade

@brief upgrade a service

@RESTHEADER{PATCH /_api/foxx/service, Upgrade service}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Installs the given new service on top of the service currently installed at the given mount path.
This is only recommended for switching between different versions of the same service.

Unlike replacing a service, upgrading a service retains the old service's configuration
and dependencies (if any) and should therefore only be used to migrate an existing service
to a newer or equivalent service.

The request body can be any of the following formats:

- `application/zip`: a raw zip bundle containing a service
- `application/javascript`: a standalone JavaScript file
- `application/json`: a service definition as JSON
- `multipart/form-data`: a service definition as a multipart form

A service definition is an object or form with the following properties or fields:

- *configuration*: a JSON object describing configuration values
- *dependencies*: a JSON object describing dependency settings
- *source*: a fully qualified URL or an absolute path on the server's file system

When using multipart data, the *source* field can also alternatively be a file field
containing either a zip bundle or a standalone JavaScript file.

When using a standalone JavaScript file the given file will be executed
to define our service's HTTP endpoints. It is the same which would be defined
in the field `main` of the service manifest.

If *source* is a URL, the URL must be reachable from the server.
If *source* is a file system path, the path will be resolved on the server.
In either case the path or URL is expected to resolve to a zip bundle,
JavaScript file or (in case of a file system path) directory.

Note that when using file system paths in a cluster with multiple Coordinators
the file system path must resolve to equivalent files on every Coordinator.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{mount,string,required}
Mount path of the installed service.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{teardown,boolean,optional}
Set to `true` to run the old service's teardown script.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{setup,boolean,optional}
Set to `false` to not run the new service's setup script.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{legacy,boolean,optional}
Set to `true` to install the new service in 2.8 legacy compatibility mode.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{force,boolean,optional}
Set to `true` to force service install even if no service is installed under given mount.

@brief replace a service

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/foxx/service, Replace service}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Removes the service at the given mount path from the database and file system.
Then installs the given new service at the same mount path.

This is a slightly safer equivalent to performing an uninstall of the old service
followed by installing the new service. The new service's main and script files
(if any) will be checked for basic syntax errors before the old service is removed.

The request body can be any of the following formats:

- `application/zip`: a raw zip bundle containing a service
- `application/javascript`: a standalone JavaScript file
- `application/json`: a service definition as JSON
- `multipart/form-data`: a service definition as a multipart form

A service definition is an object or form with the following properties or fields:

- *configuration*: a JSON object describing configuration values
- *dependencies*: a JSON object describing dependency settings
- *source*: a fully qualified URL or an absolute path on the server's file system

When using multipart data, the *source* field can also alternatively be a file field
containing either a zip bundle or a standalone JavaScript file.

When using a standalone JavaScript file the given file will be executed
to define our service's HTTP endpoints. It is the same which would be defined
in the field `main` of the service manifest.

If *source* is a URL, the URL must be reachable from the server.
If *source* is a file system path, the path will be resolved on the server.
In either case the path or URL is expected to resolve to a zip bundle,
JavaScript file or (in case of a file system path) directory.

Note that when using file system paths in a cluster with multiple Coordinators
the file system path must resolve to equivalent files on every Coordinator.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Runs the tests for the service at the given mount path and returns the results.

Supported test reporters are:

- *default*: a simple list of test cases
- *suite*: an object of test cases nested in suites
- *stream*: a raw stream of test results
- *xunit*: an XUnit/JUnit compatible structure
- *tap*: a raw TAP compatible stream

The *Accept* request header can be used to further control the response format:

When using the *stream* reporter `application/x-ldjson` will result
in the response body being formatted as a newline-delimited JSON stream.

When using the *tap* reporter `text/plain` or `text/*` will result
in the response body being formatted as a plain text TAP report.

When using the *xunit* reporter `application/xml` or `text/xml` will result
in the response body being formatted as XML instead of JSONML.

Otherwise the response body will be formatted as non-prettyprinted JSON.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{mount,string,required}
Mount path of the installed service.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{reporter,string,optional}
Test reporter to use.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{idiomatic,boolean,optional}

@startDocuBlock delete_remove_document_MULTI

@brief removes multiple document

@RESTHEADER{DELETE /_api/document/{collection},Removes multiple documents,removeDocuments}

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{array,json,required}
A JSON array of strings or documents.

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection,string,required}
Collection from which documents are removed.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Wait until deletion operation has been synced to disk.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnOld,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete previous revision of the changed
document under the attribute *old* in the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{ignoreRevs,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, ignore any *_rev* attribute in the selectors. No
revision check is performed. If set to *false* then revisions are checked.
The default is *true*.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
The body of the request is an array consisting of selectors for
documents. A selector can either be a string with a key or a string
with a document identifier or an object with a *_key* attribute. This
API call removes all specified documents from *collection*.
If the *ignoreRevs* query parameter is *false* and the
selector is an object and has a *_rev* attribute, it is a
precondition that the actual revision of the removed document in the
collection is the specified one.

The body of the response is an array of the same length as the input
array. For each input selector, the output contains a JSON object
with the information about the outcome of the operation. If no error
occurred, an object is built in which the attribute *_id* contains
the known *document-id* of the removed document, *_key* contains
the key which uniquely identifies a document in a given collection,
and the attribute *_rev* contains the document revision. In case of
an error, an object with the attribute *error* set to *true* and
*errorCode* set to the error code is built.

If the *waitForSync* parameter is not specified or set to *false*,
then the collection's default *waitForSync* behavior is applied.
The *waitForSync* query parameter cannot be used to disable
synchronization for collections that have a default *waitForSync*
value of *true*.

If the query parameter *returnOld* is *true*, then
the complete previous revision of the document
is returned under the *old* attribute in the result.

Note that if any precondition is violated or an error occurred with
some of the documents, the return code is still 200 or 202, but
the additional HTTP header *X-Arango-Error-Codes* is set, which
contains a map of the error codes that occurred together with their
multiplicities, as in: *1200:17,1205:10* which means that in 17
cases the error 1200 "revision conflict" and in 10 cases the error
1205 "illegal document handle" has happened.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if *waitForSync* was *true*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
is returned if *waitForSync* was *false*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection was not found.
The response body contains an error document in this case.

@startDocuBlock put_replace_document_MULTI

@brief replaces multiple documents

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/document/{collection},Replace documents,replaceDocuments}

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{documents,json,required}
A JSON representation of an array of documents.

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection,string,required}
This URL parameter is the name of the collection in which the
documents are replaced.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Wait until the new documents have been synced to disk.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{ignoreRevs,boolean,optional}
By default, or if this is set to *true*, the *_rev* attributes in
the given documents are ignored. If this is set to *false*, then
any *_rev* attribute given in a body document is taken as a
precondition. The document is only replaced if the current revision
is the one specified.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnOld,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete previous revision of the changed
documents under the attribute *old* in the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnNew,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete new documents under the attribute *new*
in the result.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Replaces multiple documents in the specified collection with the
ones in the body, the replaced documents are specified by the *_key*
attributes in the body documents.

The value of the `_key` attribute as well as attributes
used as sharding keys may not be changed.

If *ignoreRevs* is *false* and there is a *_rev* attribute in a
document in the body and its value does not match the revision of
the corresponding document in the database, the precondition is
violated.

Cluster only: The replace documents _may_ contain
values for the collection's pre-defined shard keys. Values for the shard keys
are treated as hints to improve performance. Should the shard keys
values be incorrect ArangoDB may answer with a *not found* error.

Optionally, the query parameter *waitForSync* can be used to force
synchronization of the document replacement operation to disk even in case
that the *waitForSync* flag had been disabled for the entire collection.
Thus, the *waitForSync* query parameter can be used to force synchronization
of just specific operations. To use this, set the *waitForSync* parameter
to *true*. If the *waitForSync* parameter is not specified or set to
*false*, then the collection's default *waitForSync* behavior is
applied. The *waitForSync* query parameter cannot be used to disable
synchronization for collections that have a default *waitForSync* value
of *true*.

The body of the response contains a JSON array of the same length
as the input array with the information about the identifier and the
revision of the replaced documents. In each entry, the attribute
*_id* contains the known *document-id* of each updated document,
*_key* contains the key which uniquely identifies a document in a
given collection, and the attribute *_rev* contains the new document
revision. In case of an error or violated precondition, an error
object with the attribute *error* set to *true* and the attribute
*errorCode* set to the error code is built.

If the query parameter *returnOld* is *true*, then, for each
generated document, the complete previous revision of the document
is returned under the *old* attribute in the result.

If the query parameter *returnNew* is *true*, then, for each
generated document, the complete new document is returned under
the *new* attribute in the result.

Note that if any precondition is violated or an error occurred with
some of the documents, the return code is still 201 or 202, but
the additional HTTP header *X-Arango-Error-Codes* is set, which
contains a map of the error codes that occurred together with their
multiplicities, as in: *1200:17,1205:10* which means that in 17
cases the error 1200 "revision conflict" and in 10 cases the error
1205 "illegal document handle" has happened.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if *waitForSync* was *true* and operations were processed.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
is returned if *waitForSync* was *false* and operations were processed.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation
of an array of documents. The response body contains
an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection was not found.

@startDocuBlock head_read_document_header

@brief reads a single document head

@RESTHEADER{HEAD /_api/document/{collection}/{key},Read document header,checkDocument}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection,string,required}
Name of the *collection* from which the document is to be read.

@RESTURLPARAM{key,string,required}
The document key.

@RESTHEADERPARAMETERS

@RESTHEADERPARAM{If-None-Match,string,optional}
If the "If-None-Match" header is given, then it must contain exactly one
Etag. If the current document revision is not equal to the specified Etag,
an *HTTP 200* response is returned. If the current document revision is
identical to the specified Etag, then an *HTTP 304* is returned.

@RESTHEADERPARAM{If-Match,string,optional}
If the "If-Match" header is given, then it must contain exactly one
Etag. The document is returned, if it has the same revision as the
given Etag. Otherwise a *HTTP 412* is returned.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Like *GET*, but only returns the header fields and not the body. You
can use this call to get the current revision of a document or check if
the document was deleted.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the document was found

@RESTRETURNCODE{304}
is returned if the "If-None-Match" header is given and the document has
the same version

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the document or collection was not found

@RESTRETURNCODE{412}
is returned if an "If-Match" header is given and the found
document has a different version. The response will also contain the found
document's current revision in the *Etag* header.

@startDocuBlock post_create_document_MULTI

@brief creates multiple documents

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/document/{collection}#multiple,Create multiple documents,insertDocuments}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection,string,required}
Name of the *collection* in which the documents are to be created.

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{data,json,required}
An array of documents to create.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,optional}
The name of the collection. This is only for backward compatibility.
In ArangoDB versions < 3.0, the URL path was */_api/document* and
this query parameter was required. This combination still works, but
the recommended way is to specify the collection in the URL path.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Wait until document has been synced to disk.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnNew,boolean,optional}
Additionally return the complete new document under the attribute *new*
in the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnOld,boolean,optional}
Additionally return the complete old document under the attribute *old*
in the result. Only available if the overwrite option is used.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{silent,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, an empty object will be returned as response. No meta-data
will be returned for the created document. This option can be used to
save some network traffic.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{overwrite,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, the insert becomes a replace-insert. If a document with the
same *_key* already exists the new document is not rejected with unique
constraint violated but will replace the old document. Note that operations
with `overwrite` parameter require a `_key` attribute in the request payload,
therefore they can only be performed on collections sharded by `_key`.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{overwriteMode,string,optional}
This option supersedes *overwrite* and offers the following modes:
- `"ignore"`: if a document with the specified *_key* value exists already,
  nothing will be done and no write operation will be carried out. The
  insert operation will return success in this case. This mode does not
  support returning the old document version using `RETURN OLD`. When using
  `RETURN NEW`, *null* will be returned in case the document already existed.
- `"replace"`: if a document with the specified *_key* value exists already,
  it will be overwritten with the specified document value. This mode will
  also be used when no overwrite mode is specified but the *overwrite*
  flag is set to *true*.
- `"update"`: if a document with the specified *_key* value exists already,
  it will be patched (partially updated) with the specified document value.
  The overwrite mode can be further controlled via the *keepNull* and
  *mergeObjects* parameters.
- `"conflict"`: if a document with the specified *_key* value exists already,
  return a unique constraint violation error so that the insert operation
  fails. This is also the default behavior in case the overwrite mode is
  not set, and the *overwrite* flag is *false* or not set either.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{keepNull,boolean,optional}
If the intention is to delete existing attributes with the update-insert
command, the URL query parameter *keepNull* can be used with a value of
*false*. This will modify the behavior of the patch command to remove any
attributes from the existing document that are contained in the patch document
with an attribute value of *null*.
This option controls the update-insert behavior only.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{mergeObjects,boolean,optional}
Controls whether objects (not arrays) will be merged if present in both the
existing and the update-insert document. If set to *false*, the value in the
patch document will overwrite the existing document's value. If set to *true*,
objects will be merged. The default is *true*.
This option controls the update-insert behavior only.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Creates new documents from the documents given in the body, unless there
is already a document with the *_key* given. If no *_key* is given, a new
unique *_key* is generated automatically.

The result body will contain a JSON array of the
same length as the input array, and each entry contains the result
of the operation for the corresponding input. In case of an error
the entry is a document with attributes *error* set to *true* and
errorCode set to the error code that has happened.

Possibly given *_id* and *_rev* attributes in the body are always ignored,
the URL part or the query parameter collection respectively counts.

If *silent* is not set to *true*, the body of the response contains an
array of JSON objects with the following attributes:

  - *_id* contains the document identifier of the newly created document
  - *_key* contains the document key
  - *_rev* contains the document revision

If the collection parameter *waitForSync* is *false*, then the call
returns as soon as the documents have been accepted. It will not wait
until the documents have been synced to disk.

Optionally, the query parameter *waitForSync* can be used to force
synchronization of the document creation operation to disk even in
case that the *waitForSync* flag had been disabled for the entire
collection. Thus, the *waitForSync* query parameter can be used to
force synchronization of just this specific operations. To use this,
set the *waitForSync* parameter to *true*. If the *waitForSync*
parameter is not specified or set to *false*, then the collection's
default *waitForSync* behavior is applied. The *waitForSync* query
parameter cannot be used to disable synchronization for collections
that have a default *waitForSync* value of *true*.

If the query parameter *returnNew* is *true*, then, for each
generated document, the complete new document is returned under
the *new* attribute in the result.

Should an error have occurred with some of the documents
the additional HTTP header *X-Arango-Error-Codes* is set, which
contains a map of the error codes that occurred together with their
multiplicities, as in: *1205:10,1210:17* which means that in 10
cases the error 1205 "illegal document handle" and in 17 cases the
error 1210 "unique constraint violated" has happened.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if *waitForSync* was *true* and operations were processed.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
is returned if *waitForSync* was *false* and operations were processed.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation
of an array of documents. The response body contains
an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection specified by *collection* is unknown.
The response body contains an error document in this case.

@brief removes a document

@RESTHEADER{DELETE /_api/document/{collection}/{key},Removes a document,removeDocument}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection,string,required}
Name of the *collection* in which the document is to be deleted.

@RESTURLPARAM{key,string,required}
The document key.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Wait until deletion operation has been synced to disk.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnOld,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete previous revision of the changed
document under the attribute *old* in the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{silent,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, an empty object will be returned as response. No meta-data
will be returned for the removed document. This option can be used to
save some network traffic.

@RESTHEADERPARAMETERS

@RESTHEADERPARAM{If-Match,string,optional}
You can conditionally remove a document based on a target revision id by
using the *if-match* HTTP header.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
If *silent* is not set to *true*, the body of the response contains a JSON
object with the information about the identifier and the revision. The attribute
*_id* contains the known *document-id* of the removed document, *_key*
contains the key which uniquely identifies a document in a given collection,
and the attribute *_rev* contains the document revision.

If the *waitForSync* parameter is not specified or set to *false*,
then the collection's default *waitForSync* behavior is applied.
The *waitForSync* query parameter cannot be used to disable
synchronization for collections that have a default *waitForSync*
value of *true*.

If the query parameter *returnOld* is *true*, then
the complete previous revision of the document
is returned under the *old* attribute in the result.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the document was removed successfully and
*waitForSync* was *true*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
is returned if the document was removed successfully and
*waitForSync* was *false*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection or the document was not found.
The response body contains an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{412}
is returned if a "If-Match" header or *rev* is given and the found
document has a different version. The response will also contain the found
document's current revision in the *_rev* attribute. Additionally, the
attributes *_id* and *_key* will be returned.

@startDocuBlock post_create_document

@brief creates documents

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/document/{collection},Create document,insertDocument}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection,string,required}
Name of the *collection* in which the document is to be created.

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{data,json,required}
A JSON representation of a single document.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,optional}
The name of the collection. This is only for backward compatibility.
In ArangoDB versions < 3.0, the URL path was */_api/document* and
this query parameter was required. This combination still works, but
the recommended way is to specify the collection in the URL path.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Wait until document has been synced to disk.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnNew,boolean,optional}
Additionally return the complete new document under the attribute *new*
in the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnOld,boolean,optional}
Additionally return the complete old document under the attribute *old*
in the result. Only available if the overwrite option is used.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{silent,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, an empty object will be returned as response. No meta-data
will be returned for the created document. This option can be used to
save some network traffic.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{overwrite,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, the insert becomes a replace-insert. If a document with the
same *_key* already exists the new document is not rejected with unique
constraint violated but will replace the old document. Note that operations
with `overwrite` parameter require a `_key` attribute in the request payload,
therefore they can only be performed on collections sharded by `_key`.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{overwriteMode,string,optional}
This option supersedes *overwrite* and offers the following modes:
- `"ignore"`: if a document with the specified *_key* value exists already,
  nothing will be done and no write operation will be carried out. The
  insert operation will return success in this case. This mode does not
  support returning the old document version using `RETURN OLD`. When using
  `RETURN NEW`, *null* will be returned in case the document already existed.
- `"replace"`: if a document with the specified *_key* value exists already,
  it will be overwritten with the specified document value. This mode will
  also be used when no overwrite mode is specified but the *overwrite*
  flag is set to *true*.
- `"update"`: if a document with the specified *_key* value exists already,
  it will be patched (partially updated) with the specified document value.
  The overwrite mode can be further controlled via the *keepNull* and
  *mergeObjects* parameters.
- `"conflict"`: if a document with the specified *_key* value exists already,
  return a unique constraint violation error so that the insert operation
  fails. This is also the default behavior in case the overwrite mode is
  not set, and the *overwrite* flag is *false* or not set either.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{keepNull,boolean,optional}
If the intention is to delete existing attributes with the update-insert
command, the URL query parameter *keepNull* can be used with a value of
*false*. This will modify the behavior of the patch command to remove any
attributes from the existing document that are contained in the patch document
with an attribute value of *null*.
This option controls the update-insert behavior only.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{mergeObjects,boolean,optional}
Controls whether objects (not arrays) will be merged if present in both the
existing and the update-insert document. If set to *false*, the value in the
patch document will overwrite the existing document's value. If set to *true*,
objects will be merged. The default is *true*.
This option controls the update-insert behavior only.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Creates a new document from the document given in the body, unless there
is already a document with the *_key* given. If no *_key* is given, a new
unique *_key* is generated automatically.

Possibly given *_id* and *_rev* attributes in the body are always ignored,
the URL part or the query parameter collection respectively counts.

If the document was created successfully, then the *Location* header
contains the path to the newly created document. The *Etag* header field
contains the revision of the document. Both are only set in the single
document case.

If *silent* is not set to *true*, the body of the response contains a
JSON object with the following attributes:

  - *_id* contains the document identifier of the newly created document
  - *_key* contains the document key
  - *_rev* contains the document revision

If the collection parameter *waitForSync* is *false*, then the call
returns as soon as the document has been accepted. It will not wait
until the documents have been synced to disk.

Optionally, the query parameter *waitForSync* can be used to force
synchronization of the document creation operation to disk even in
case that the *waitForSync* flag had been disabled for the entire
collection. Thus, the *waitForSync* query parameter can be used to
force synchronization of just this specific operations. To use this,
set the *waitForSync* parameter to *true*. If the *waitForSync*
parameter is not specified or set to *false*, then the collection's
default *waitForSync* behavior is applied. The *waitForSync* query
parameter cannot be used to disable synchronization for collections
that have a default *waitForSync* value of *true*.

If the query parameter *returnNew* is *true*, then, for each
generated document, the complete new document is returned under
the *new* attribute in the result.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the documents were created successfully and
*waitForSync* was *true*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
is returned if the documents were created successfully and
*waitForSync* was *false*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation
of one document. The response body contains
an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection specified by *collection* is unknown.
The response body contains an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{409}
is returned in the single document case if a document with the
same qualifiers in an indexed attribute conflicts with an already
existing document and thus violates that unique constraint. The
response body contains an error document in this case.

@EXAMPLES

Create a document in a collection named *products*. Note that the
revision identifier might or might not by equal to the auto-generated
key.

@startDocuBlock put_replace_document

@brief replaces a document

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/document/{collection}/{key},Replace document,replaceDocument}

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{document,json,required}
A JSON representation of a single document.

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection,string,required}
Name of the *collection* in which the document is to be replaced.

@RESTURLPARAM{key,string,required}
The document key.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Wait until document has been synced to disk.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{ignoreRevs,boolean,optional}
By default, or if this is set to *true*, the *_rev* attributes in
the given document is ignored. If this is set to *false*, then
the *_rev* attribute given in the body document is taken as a
precondition. The document is only replaced if the current revision
is the one specified.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnOld,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete previous revision of the changed
document under the attribute *old* in the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnNew,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete new document under the attribute *new*
in the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{silent,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, an empty object will be returned as response. No meta-data
will be returned for the replaced document. This option can be used to
save some network traffic.

@RESTHEADERPARAMETERS

@RESTHEADERPARAM{If-Match,string,optional}
You can conditionally replace a document based on a target revision id by
using the *if-match* HTTP header.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Replaces the specified document with the one in the body, provided there is
such a document and no precondition is violated.

The value of the `_key` attribute as well as attributes
used as sharding keys may not be changed.

If the *If-Match* header is specified and the revision of the
document in the database is unequal to the given revision, the
precondition is violated.

If *If-Match* is not given and *ignoreRevs* is *false* and there
is a *_rev* attribute in the body and its value does not match
the revision of the document in the database, the precondition is
violated.

If a precondition is violated, an *HTTP 412* is returned.

If the document exists and can be updated, then an *HTTP 201* or
an *HTTP 202* is returned (depending on *waitForSync*, see below),
the *Etag* header field contains the new revision of the document
and the *Location* header contains a complete URL under which the
document can be queried.

Cluster only: The replace documents _may_ contain
values for the collection's pre-defined shard keys. Values for the shard keys
are treated as hints to improve performance. Should the shard keys
values be incorrect ArangoDB may answer with a *not found* error.

Optionally, the query parameter *waitForSync* can be used to force
synchronization of the document replacement operation to disk even in case
that the *waitForSync* flag had been disabled for the entire collection.
Thus, the *waitForSync* query parameter can be used to force synchronization
of just specific operations. To use this, set the *waitForSync* parameter
to *true*. If the *waitForSync* parameter is not specified or set to
*false*, then the collection's default *waitForSync* behavior is
applied. The *waitForSync* query parameter cannot be used to disable
synchronization for collections that have a default *waitForSync* value
of *true*.

If *silent* is not set to *true*, the body of the response contains a JSON
object with the information about the identifier and the revision. The attribute
*_id* contains the known *document-id* of the updated document, *_key*
contains the key which uniquely identifies a document in a given collection,
and the attribute *_rev* contains the new document revision.

If the query parameter *returnOld* is *true*, then
the complete previous revision of the document
is returned under the *old* attribute in the result.

If the query parameter *returnNew* is *true*, then
the complete new document is returned under
the *new* attribute in the result.

If the document does not exist, then a *HTTP 404* is returned and the
body of the response contains an error document.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the document was replaced successfully and
*waitForSync* was *true*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
is returned if the document was replaced successfully and
*waitForSync* was *false*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation
of a document. The response body contains
an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection or the document was not found.

@RESTRETURNCODE{409}
is returned if the replace causes a unique constraint violation in 
a secondary index.

@RESTRETURNCODE{412}
is returned if the precondition was violated. The response will
also contain the found documents' current revisions in the *_rev*
attributes. Additionally, the attributes *_id* and *_key* will be
returned.

@startDocuBlock patch_update_document

@brief updates a document

@RESTHEADER{PATCH /_api/document/{collection}/{key},Update document,updateDocument}

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{document,json,required}
A JSON representation of a document update as an object.

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection,string,required}
Name of the *collection* in which the document is to be updated.

@RESTURLPARAM{key,string,required}
The document key.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{keepNull,boolean,optional}
If the intention is to delete existing attributes with the patch
command, the URL query parameter *keepNull* can be used with a value
of *false*. This will modify the behavior of the patch command to
remove any attributes from the existing document that are contained
in the patch document with an attribute value of *null*.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{mergeObjects,boolean,optional}
Controls whether objects (not arrays) will be merged if present in
both the existing and the patch document. If set to *false*, the
value in the patch document will overwrite the existing document's
value. If set to *true*, objects will be merged. The default is
*true*.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Wait until document has been synced to disk.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{ignoreRevs,boolean,optional}
By default, or if this is set to *true*, the *_rev* attributes in
the given document is ignored. If this is set to *false*, then
the *_rev* attribute given in the body document is taken as a
precondition. The document is only updated if the current revision
is the one specified.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnOld,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete previous revision of the changed
document under the attribute *old* in the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnNew,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete new document under the attribute *new*
in the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{silent,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, an empty object will be returned as response. No meta-data
will be returned for the updated document. This option can be used to
save some network traffic.

@RESTHEADERPARAMETERS

@RESTHEADERPARAM{If-Match,string,optional}
You can conditionally update a document based on a target revision id by
using the *if-match* HTTP header.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Partially updates the document identified by *document-id*.
The body of the request must contain a JSON document with the
attributes to patch (the patch document). All attributes from the
patch document will be added to the existing document if they do not
yet exist, and overwritten in the existing document if they do exist
there.

The value of the `_key` attribute as well as attributes
used as sharding keys may not be changed.

Setting an attribute value to *null* in the patch document will cause a
value of *null* to be saved for the attribute by default.

If the *If-Match* header is specified and the revision of the
document in the database is unequal to the given revision, the
precondition is violated.

If *If-Match* is not given and *ignoreRevs* is *false* and there
is a *_rev* attribute in the body and its value does not match
the revision of the document in the database, the precondition is
violated.

If a precondition is violated, an *HTTP 412* is returned.

If the document exists and can be updated, then an *HTTP 201* or
an *HTTP 202* is returned (depending on *waitForSync*, see below),
the *Etag* header field contains the new revision of the document
(in double quotes) and the *Location* header contains a complete URL
under which the document can be queried.

Cluster only: The patch document _may_ contain
values for the collection's pre-defined shard keys. Values for the shard keys
are treated as hints to improve performance. Should the shard keys
values be incorrect ArangoDB may answer with a *not found* error

Optionally, the query parameter *waitForSync* can be used to force
synchronization of the updated document operation to disk even in case
that the *waitForSync* flag had been disabled for the entire collection.
Thus, the *waitForSync* query parameter can be used to force synchronization
of just specific operations. To use this, set the *waitForSync* parameter
to *true*. If the *waitForSync* parameter is not specified or set to
*false*, then the collection's default *waitForSync* behavior is
applied. The *waitForSync* query parameter cannot be used to disable
synchronization for collections that have a default *waitForSync* value
of *true*.

If *silent* is not set to *true*, the body of the response contains a JSON
object with the information about the identifier and the revision. The attribute
*_id* contains the known *document-id* of the updated document, *_key*
contains the key which uniquely identifies a document in a given collection,
and the attribute *_rev* contains the new document revision.

If the query parameter *returnOld* is *true*, then
the complete previous revision of the document
is returned under the *old* attribute in the result.

If the query parameter *returnNew* is *true*, then
the complete new document is returned under
the *new* attribute in the result.

If the document does not exist, then a *HTTP 404* is returned and the
body of the response contains an error document.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the document was updated successfully and
*waitForSync* was *true*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
is returned if the document was updated successfully and
*waitForSync* was *false*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation
of a document. The response body contains
an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection or the document was not found.

@RESTRETURNCODE{409}
is returned if the update causes a unique constraint violation in 
a secondary index.

@RESTRETURNCODE{412}
is returned if the precondition was violated. The response will
also contain the found documents' current revisions in the *_rev*
attributes. Additionally, the attributes *_id* and *_key* will be
returned.

@startDocuBlock get_read_document_MULTI

@brief reads a single document

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/document/{collection}#get,Read multiple documents,readDocuments}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection,string,required}
Name of the *collection* from which the documents are to be read.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{onlyget,boolean,required}
This parameter is required to be **true**, otherwise a replace
operation is executed!

@RESTQUERYPARAM{ignoreRevs,string,optional}
Should the value be *true* (the default):
If a search document contains a value for the *_rev* field,
then the document is only returned if it has the same revision value.
Otherwise a precondition failed error is returned.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the documents identified by their *_key* in the body objects.
The body of the request _must_ contain a JSON array of either
strings (the *_key* values to lookup) or search documents.

A search document _must_ contain at least a value for the *_key* field.
A value for `_rev` _may_ be specified to verify whether the document
has the same revision value, unless _ignoreRevs_ is set to false.

Cluster only: The search document _may_ contain
values for the collection's pre-defined shard keys. Values for the shard keys
are treated as hints to improve performance. Should the shard keys
values be incorrect ArangoDB may answer with a *not found* error.

The returned array of documents contain three special attributes: *_id* containing the document
identifier, *_key* containing key which uniquely identifies a document
in a given collection and *_rev* containing the revision.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if no error happened

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation
of an array of documents. The response body contains
an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection was not found.

@EXAMPLES

@startDocuBlock patch_update_document_MULTI

@brief updates multiple documents

@RESTHEADER{PATCH /_api/document/{collection},Update documents,updateDocuments}

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{documents,json,required}
A JSON representation of an array of document updates as objects.

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection,string,required}
Name of the *collection* in which the documents are to be updated.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{keepNull,boolean,optional}
If the intention is to delete existing attributes with the patch
command, the URL query parameter *keepNull* can be used with a value
of *false*. This will modify the behavior of the patch command to
remove any attributes from the existing document that are contained
in the patch document with an attribute value of *null*.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{mergeObjects,boolean,optional}
Controls whether objects (not arrays) will be merged if present in
both the existing and the patch document. If set to *false*, the
value in the patch document will overwrite the existing document's
value. If set to *true*, objects will be merged. The default is
*true*.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Wait until the new documents have been synced to disk.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{ignoreRevs,boolean,optional}
By default, or if this is set to *true*, the *_rev* attributes in
the given documents are ignored. If this is set to *false*, then
any *_rev* attribute given in a body document is taken as a
precondition. The document is only updated if the current revision
is the one specified.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnOld,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete previous revision of the changed
documents under the attribute *old* in the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnNew,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete new documents under the attribute *new*
in the result.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Partially updates documents, the documents to update are specified
by the *_key* attributes in the body objects. The body of the
request must contain a JSON array of document updates with the
attributes to patch (the patch documents). All attributes from the
patch documents will be added to the existing documents if they do
not yet exist, and overwritten in the existing documents if they do
exist there.

The value of the `_key` attribute as well as attributes
used as sharding keys may not be changed.

Setting an attribute value to *null* in the patch documents will cause a
value of *null* to be saved for the attribute by default.

If *ignoreRevs* is *false* and there is a *_rev* attribute in a
document in the body and its value does not match the revision of
the corresponding document in the database, the precondition is
violated.

Cluster only: The patch document _may_ contain
values for the collection's pre-defined shard keys. Values for the shard keys
are treated as hints to improve performance. Should the shard keys
values be incorrect ArangoDB may answer with a *not found* error

Optionally, the query parameter *waitForSync* can be used to force
synchronization of the document replacement operation to disk even in case
that the *waitForSync* flag had been disabled for the entire collection.
Thus, the *waitForSync* query parameter can be used to force synchronization
of just specific operations. To use this, set the *waitForSync* parameter
to *true*. If the *waitForSync* parameter is not specified or set to
*false*, then the collection's default *waitForSync* behavior is
applied. The *waitForSync* query parameter cannot be used to disable
synchronization for collections that have a default *waitForSync* value
of *true*.

The body of the response contains a JSON array of the same length
as the input array with the information about the identifier and the
revision of the updated documents. In each entry, the attribute
*_id* contains the known *document-id* of each updated document,
*_key* contains the key which uniquely identifies a document in a
given collection, and the attribute *_rev* contains the new document
revision. In case of an error or violated precondition, an error
object with the attribute *error* set to *true* and the attribute
*errorCode* set to the error code is built.

If the query parameter *returnOld* is *true*, then, for each
generated document, the complete previous revision of the document
is returned under the *old* attribute in the result.

If the query parameter *returnNew* is *true*, then, for each
generated document, the complete new document is returned under
the *new* attribute in the result.

Note that if any precondition is violated or an error occurred with
some of the documents, the return code is still 201 or 202, but
the additional HTTP header *X-Arango-Error-Codes* is set, which
contains a map of the error codes that occurred together with their
multiplicities, as in: *1200:17,1205:10* which means that in 17
cases the error 1200 "revision conflict" and in 10 cases the error
1205 "illegal document handle" has happened.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if *waitForSync* was *true* and operations were processed.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
is returned if *waitForSync* was *false* and operations were processed.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation
of an array of documents. The response body contains
an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection was not found.

@brief Returns the health of the cluster as assessed by the supervision (Agency)

@RESTHEADER{GET /_admin/cluster/health, Queries the health of cluster for monitoring}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Queries the health of the cluster for monitoring purposes. The response is a JSON object, containing the standard `code`, `error`, `errorNum`, and `errorMessage` fields as appropriate. The endpoint-specific fields are as follows:

- `ClusterId`: A UUID string identifying the cluster
- `Health`: An object containing a descriptive sub-object for each node in the cluster.
  - `<nodeID>`: Each entry in `Health` will be keyed by the node ID and contain the following attributes:
    - `Endpoint`: A string representing the network endpoint of the server.
    - `Role`: The role the server plays. Possible values are `"AGENT"`, `"COORDINATOR"`, and `"DBSERVER"`.
    - `CanBeDeleted`: Boolean representing whether the node can safely be removed from the cluster.
    - `Version`: Version String of ArangoDB used by that node.
    - `Engine`: Storage Engine used by that node.
    - `Status`: A string indicating the health of the node as assessed by the supervision (Agency). This should be considered primary source of truth for Coordinator and DB-Servers node health. If the node is responding normally to requests, it is `"GOOD"`. If it has missed one heartbeat, it is `"BAD"`. If it has been declared failed by the supervision, which occurs after missing heartbeats for about 15 seconds, it will be marked `"FAILED"`.

    Additionally it will also have the following attributes for:

    **Coordinators** and **DB-Servers**
    - `SyncStatus`: The last sync status reported by the node. This value is primarily used to determine the value of `Status`. Possible values include `"UNKNOWN"`, `"UNDEFINED"`, `"STARTUP"`, `"STOPPING"`, `"STOPPED"`, `"SERVING"`, `"SHUTDOWN"`.
    - `LastAckedTime`: ISO 8601 timestamp specifying the last heartbeat received.
    - `ShortName`: A string representing the shortname of the server, e.g. `"Coordinator0001"`.
    - `Timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp specifying the last heartbeat received. (deprecated)
    - `Host`: An optional string, specifying the host machine if known.

    **Coordinators** only
    - `AdvertisedEndpoint`: A string representing the advertised endpoint, if set. (e.g. external IP address or load balancer, optional)

    **Agents**
    - `Leader`: ID of the Agent this node regards as leader.
    - `Leading`: Whether this Agent is the leader (true) or not (false).
    - `LastAckedTime`: Time since last `acked` in seconds.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200} is returned when everything went well.

<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/Rest/Replication/get_api_replication_applier_state.md -->
@startDocuBlock get_api_replication_applier_state

@brief output the current status of the replication

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/replication/applier-state, State of the replication applier,handleCommandApplierGetState}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{global,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, returns the state of the global replication applier for all
databases. If set to *false*, returns the state of the replication applier in the
selected database.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the state of the replication applier, regardless of whether the
applier is currently running or not.

The response is a JSON object with the following attributes:

- *state*: a JSON object with the following sub-attributes:

  - *running*: whether or not the applier is active and running

  - *lastAppliedContinuousTick*: the last tick value from the continuous
    replication log the applier has applied.

  - *lastProcessedContinuousTick*: the last tick value from the continuous
    replication log the applier has processed.

    Regularly, the last applied and last processed tick values should be
    identical. For transactional operations, the replication applier will first
    process incoming log events before applying them, so the processed tick
    value might be higher than the applied tick value. This will be the case
    until the applier encounters the *transaction commit* log event for the
    transaction.

  - *lastAvailableContinuousTick*: the last tick value the remote server can
    provide, for all databases.

  - *ticksBehind*: this attribute will be present only if the applier is currently
    running. It will provide the number of log ticks between what the applier
    has applied/seen and the last log tick value provided by the remote server.
    If this value is zero, then both servers are in sync. If this is non-zero,
    then the remote server has additional data that the applier has not yet
    fetched and processed, or the remote server may have more data that is not
    applicable to the applier.

    Client applications can use it to determine approximately how far the applier
    is behind the remote server, and can periodically check if the value is
    increasing (applier is falling behind) or decreasing (applier is catching up).

    Please note that as the remote server will only keep one last log tick value
    for all of its databases, but replication may be restricted to just certain
    databases on the applier, this value is more meaningful when the global applier
    is used.
    Additionally, the last log tick provided by the remote server may increase
    due to writes into system collections that are not replicated due to replication
    configuration. So the reported value may exaggerate the reality a bit for
    some scenarios.

  - *time*: the time on the applier server.

  - *totalRequests*: the total number of requests the applier has made to the
    endpoint.

  - *totalFailedConnects*: the total number of failed connection attempts the
    applier has made.

  - *totalEvents*: the total number of log events the applier has processed.

  - *totalOperationsExcluded*: the total number of log events excluded because
    of *restrictCollections*.

  - *progress*: a JSON object with details about the replication applier progress.
    It contains the following sub-attributes if there is progress to report:

    - *message*: a textual description of the progress

    - *time*: the date and time the progress was logged

    - *failedConnects*: the current number of failed connection attempts

  - *lastError*: a JSON object with details about the last error that happened on
    the applier. It contains the following sub-attributes if there was an error:

    - *errorNum*: a numerical error code

    - *errorMessage*: a textual error description

    - *time*: the date and time the error occurred

    In case no error has occurred, *lastError* will be empty.

- *server*: a JSON object with the following sub-attributes:

  - *version*: the applier server's version

  - *serverId*: the applier server's id

- *endpoint*: the endpoint the applier is connected to (if applier is
  active) or will connect to (if applier is currently inactive)

- *database*: the name of the database the applier is connected to (if applier is
  active) or will connect to (if applier is currently inactive)

Please note that all "tick" values returned do not have a specific unit. Tick
values are only meaningful when compared to each other. Higher tick values mean
"later in time" than lower tick values.
@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the request was executed successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
is returned if an error occurred while assembling the response.

@brief returns the state of the replication logger

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/replication/logger-state, Return replication logger state, handleCommandLoggerState}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the current state of the server's replication logger. The state will
include information about whether the logger is running and about the last
logged tick value. This tick value is important for incremental fetching of
data.

The body of the response contains a JSON object with the following
attributes:

- *state*: the current logger state as a JSON object with the following
  sub-attributes:

  - *running*: whether or not the logger is running

  - *lastLogTick*: the tick value of the latest tick the logger has logged.
    This value can be used for incremental fetching of log data.

  - *totalEvents*: total number of events logged since the server was started.
    The value is not reset between multiple stops and re-starts of the logger.

  - *time*: the current date and time on the logger server

- *server*: a JSON object with the following sub-attributes:

  - *version*: the logger server's version

  - *serverId*: the logger server's id

  the logger. Each client is returned as a JSON object with the following attributes:

  - *syncerId*: id of the client syncer

  - *serverId*: server id of client

  - *lastServedTick*: last tick value served to this client via the *logger-follow* API

  - *time*: date and time when this client last called the *logger-follow* API

@startDocuBlock get_api_replication_dump

@brief returns the whole content of one collection

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/replication/dump, Return data of a collection,handleCommandDump}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The name or id of the collection to dump.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{chunkSize,number,optional}
Approximate maximum size of the returned result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{batchId,number,required}
The id of the snapshot to use

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the data from the collection for the requested range.


The *chunkSize* query parameter can be used to control the size of the result.
It must be specified in bytes. The *chunkSize* value will only be honored
approximately. Otherwise a too low *chunkSize* value could cause the server
to not be able to put just one entry into the result and return it.
Therefore, the *chunkSize* value will only be consulted after an entry has
been written into the result. If the result size is then bigger than
*chunkSize*, the server will respond with as many entries as there are
in the response already. If the result size is still smaller than *chunkSize*,
the server will try to return more data if there's more data left to return.

If *chunkSize* is not specified, some server-side default value will be used.

The *Content-Type* of the result is *application/x-arango-dump*. This is an
easy-to-process format, with all entries going onto separate lines in the
response body.

Each line itself is a JSON object, with at least the following attributes:

- *tick*: the operation's tick attribute

- *key*: the key of the document/edge or the key used in the deletion operation

- *rev*: the revision id of the document/edge or the deletion operation

- *data*: the actual document/edge data for types 2300 and 2301. The full
  document/edge data will be returned even for updates.

- *type*: the type of entry. Possible values for *type* are:

  - 2300: document insertion/update

  - 2301: edge insertion/update

  - 2302: document/edge deletion

**Note**: there will be no distinction between inserts and updates when calling this method.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the request was executed successfully and data was returned. The header
`x-arango-replication-lastincluded` is set to the tick of the last document returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{204}
is returned if the request was executed successfully, but there was no content available.
The header `x-arango-replication-lastincluded` is `0` in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned when the collection could not be found.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
is returned if an error occurred while assembling the response.

@brief fetch the current replication configuration

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/replication/applier-config, Return configuration of replication applier, handleCommandApplierGetConfig}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{global,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, returns the configuration of the global replication applier for all
databases. If set to *false*, returns the configuration of the replication applier in the
selected database.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the configuration of the replication applier.

The body of the response is a JSON object with the configuration. The
following attributes may be present in the configuration:

- *endpoint*: the logger server to connect to (e.g. "tcp://192.168.173.13:8529").

- *database*: the name of the database to connect to (e.g. "_system").

- *username*: an optional ArangoDB username to use when connecting to the endpoint.

- *password*: the password to use when connecting to the endpoint.

- *maxConnectRetries*: the maximum number of connection attempts the applier
  will make in a row. If the applier cannot establish a connection to the
  endpoint in this number of attempts, it will stop itself.

- *connectTimeout*: the timeout (in seconds) when attempting to connect to the
  endpoint. This value is used for each connection attempt.

- *requestTimeout*: the timeout (in seconds) for individual requests to the endpoint.

- *chunkSize*: the requested maximum size for log transfer packets that
  is used when the endpoint is contacted.

- *autoStart*: whether or not to auto-start the replication applier on
  (next and following) server starts

- *adaptivePolling*: whether or not the replication applier will use
  adaptive polling.

- *includeSystem*: whether or not system collection operations will be applied

- *autoResync*: whether or not the follower should perform a full automatic
  resynchronization with the leader in case the leader cannot serve log data
  requested by the follower, or when the replication is started and no tick
  value
  can be found.

- *autoResyncRetries*: number of resynchronization retries that will be performed
  in a row when automatic resynchronization is enabled and kicks in. Setting this
  to *0* will effectively disable *autoResync*. Setting it to some other value
  will limit the number of retries that are performed. This helps preventing endless
  retries in case resynchronizations always fail.

- *initialSyncMaxWaitTime*: the maximum wait time (in seconds) that the initial
  synchronization will wait for a response from the leader when fetching initial
  collection data.
  This wait time can be used to control after what time the initial synchronization
  will give up waiting for a response and fail. This value is relevant even
  for continuous replication when *autoResync* is set to *true* because this
  may re-start the initial synchronization when the leader cannot provide
  log data the follwer requires.
  This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

- *connectionRetryWaitTime*: the time (in seconds) that the applier will
  intentionally idle before it retries connecting to the leader in case of
  connection problems.
  This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

- *idleMinWaitTime*: the minimum wait time (in seconds) that the applier will
  intentionally idle before fetching more log data from the leader in case
  the leader has already sent all its log data. This wait time can be used
  to control the frequency with which the replication applier sends HTTP log
  fetch requests to the leader in case there is no write activity on the leader.
  This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

- *idleMaxWaitTime*: the maximum wait time (in seconds) that the applier will
  intentionally idle before fetching more log data from the leader in case the
  leader has already sent all its log data and there have been previous log
  fetch attempts that resulted in no more log data. This wait time can be used
  to control the maximum frequency with which the replication applier sends HTTP
  log fetch requests to the leader in case there is no write activity on the
  leader for longer periods. This configuration value will only be used if the
  option *adaptivePolling* is set to *true*.
  This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

- *requireFromPresent*: if set to *true*, then the replication applier will check
  at start whether the start tick from which it starts or resumes replication is
  still present on the leader. If not, then there would be data loss. If
  *requireFromPresent* is *true*, the replication applier will abort with an
  appropriate error message. If set to *false*, then the replication applier will
  still start, and ignore the data loss.

- *verbose*: if set to *true*, then a log line will be emitted for all operations
  performed by the replication applier. This should be used for debugging
  replication
  problems only.

- *restrictType*: the configuration for *restrictCollections*

- *restrictCollections*: the optional array of collections to include or exclude,
  based on the setting of *restrictType*

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the request was executed successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}

@startDocuBlock put_api_replication_makeFollower

@brief Changes role to follower

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/replication/make-follower, Turn the server into a follower of another, handleCommandMakeFollower}

@RESTBODYPARAM{endpoint,string,required,string}
the leader endpoint to connect to (e.g. "tcp://192.168.173.13:8529").

@RESTBODYPARAM{database,string,required,string}
the database name on the leader (if not specified, defaults to the
name of the local current database).

@RESTBODYPARAM{username,string,optional,string}
an optional ArangoDB username to use when connecting to the leader.

@RESTBODYPARAM{password,string,required,string}
the password to use when connecting to the leader.

@RESTBODYPARAM{includeSystem,boolean,required,}
whether or not system collection operations will be applied

@RESTBODYPARAM{restrictType,string,optional,string}
an optional string value for collection filtering. When
specified, the allowed values are *include* or *exclude*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{restrictCollections,array,optional,string}
an optional array of collections for use with *restrictType*.
If *restrictType* is *include*, only the specified collections
will be synchronized. If *restrictType* is *exclude*, all but the specified
collections will be synchronized.

@RESTBODYPARAM{maxConnectRetries,integer,optional,int64}
the maximum number of connection attempts the applier
will make in a row. If the applier cannot establish a connection to the
endpoint in this number of attempts, it will stop itself.

@RESTBODYPARAM{connectTimeout,integer,optional,int64}
the timeout (in seconds) when attempting to connect to the
endpoint. This value is used for each connection attempt.

@RESTBODYPARAM{requestTimeout,integer,optional,int64}
the timeout (in seconds) for individual requests to the endpoint.

@RESTBODYPARAM{chunkSize,integer,optional,int64}
the requested maximum size for log transfer packets that
is used when the endpoint is contacted.

@RESTBODYPARAM{adaptivePolling,boolean,optional,}
whether or not the replication applier will use adaptive polling.

@RESTBODYPARAM{autoResync,boolean,optional,}
whether or not the follower should perform an automatic resynchronization with
the leader in case the leader cannot serve log data requested by the follower,
or when the replication is started and no tick value can be found.

@RESTBODYPARAM{autoResyncRetries,integer,optional,int64}
number of resynchronization retries that will be performed in a row when
automatic resynchronization is enabled and kicks in. Setting this to *0* will
effectively disable *autoResync*. Setting it to some other value will limit
the number of retries that are performed. This helps preventing endless retries
in case resynchronizations always fail.

@RESTBODYPARAM{initialSyncMaxWaitTime,integer,optional,int64}
the maximum wait time (in seconds) that the initial synchronization will
wait for a response from the leader when fetching initial collection data.
This wait time can be used to control after what time the initial synchronization
will give up waiting for a response and fail. This value is relevant even
for continuous replication when *autoResync* is set to *true* because this
may re-start the initial synchronization when the leader cannot provide
log data the follower requires.
This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{connectionRetryWaitTime,integer,optional,int64}
the time (in seconds) that the applier will intentionally idle before
it retries connecting to the leader in case of connection problems.
This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{idleMinWaitTime,integer,optional,int64}
the minimum wait time (in seconds) that the applier will intentionally idle
before fetching more log data from the leader in case the leader has
already sent all its log data. This wait time can be used to control the
frequency with which the replication applier sends HTTP log fetch requests
to the leader in case there is no write activity on the leader.
This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{idleMaxWaitTime,integer,optional,int64}
the maximum wait time (in seconds) that the applier will intentionally idle
before fetching more log data from the leader in case the leader has
already sent all its log data and there have been previous log fetch attempts
that resulted in no more log data. This wait time can be used to control the
maximum frequency with which the replication applier sends HTTP log fetch
requests to the leader in case there is no write activity on the leader for
longer periods. This configuration value will only be used if the option
*adaptivePolling* is set to *true*.
This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{requireFromPresent,boolean,optional,}
if set to *true*, then the replication applier will check
at start of its continuous replication if the start tick from the dump phase
is still present on the leader. If not, then there would be data loss. If
*requireFromPresent* is *true*, the replication applier will abort with an
appropriate error message. If set to *false*, then the replication applier will
still start, and ignore the data loss.

@RESTBODYPARAM{verbose,boolean,optional,}
if set to *true*, then a log line will be emitted for all operations
performed by the replication applier. This should be used for debugging
replication
problems only.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Starts a full data synchronization from a remote endpoint into the local ArangoDB
database and afterwards starts the continuous replication.
The operation works on a per-database level.

All local database data will be removed prior to the synchronization.

In case of success, the body of the response is a JSON object with the following
attributes:

- *state*: a JSON object with the following sub-attributes:

  - *running*: whether or not the applier is active and running

  - *lastAppliedContinuousTick*: the last tick value from the continuous
    replication log the applier has applied.

  - *lastProcessedContinuousTick*: the last tick value from the continuous
    replication log the applier has processed.

    Regularly, the last applied and last processed tick values should be
    identical. For transactional operations, the replication applier will first
    process incoming log events before applying them, so the processed tick
    value might be higher than the applied tick value. This will be the case
    until the applier encounters the *transaction commit* log event for the
    transaction.

  - *lastAvailableContinuousTick*: the last tick value the remote server can
    provide.

  - *ticksBehind*: this attribute will be present only if the applier is currently
    running. It will provide the number of log ticks between what the applier
    has applied/seen and the last log tick value provided by the remote server.
    If this value is zero, then both servers are in sync. If this is non-zero,
    then the remote server has additional data that the applier has not yet
    fetched and processed, or the remote server may have more data that is not
    applicable to the applier.

    Client applications can use it to determine approximately how far the applier
    is behind the remote server, and can periodically check if the value is
    increasing (applier is falling behind) or decreasing (applier is catching up).

    Please note that as the remote server will only keep one last log tick value
    for all of its databases, but replication may be restricted to just certain
    databases on the applier, this value is more meaningful when the global applier
    is used.
    Additionally, the last log tick provided by the remote server may increase
    due to writes into system collections that are not replicated due to replication
    configuration. So the reported value may exaggerate the reality a bit for
    some scenarios.

  - *time*: the time on the applier server.

  - *totalRequests*: the total number of requests the applier has made to the
    endpoint.

  - *totalFailedConnects*: the total number of failed connection attempts the
    applier has made.

  - *totalEvents*: the total number of log events the applier has processed.

  - *totalOperationsExcluded*: the total number of log events excluded because
    of *restrictCollections*.

  - *progress*: a JSON object with details about the replication applier progress.
    It contains the following sub-attributes if there is progress to report:

    - *message*: a textual description of the progress

    - *time*: the date and time the progress was logged

    - *failedConnects*: the current number of failed connection attempts

  - *lastError*: a JSON object with details about the last error that happened on
    the applier. It contains the following sub-attributes if there was an error:

    - *errorNum*: a numerical error code

    - *errorMessage*: a textual error description

    - *time*: the date and time the error occurred

    In case no error has occurred, *lastError* will be empty.

- *server*: a JSON object with the following sub-attributes:

  - *version*: the applier server's version

  - *serverId*: the applier server's id

- *endpoint*: the endpoint the applier is connected to (if applier is
  active) or will connect to (if applier is currently inactive)

- *database*: the name of the database the applier is connected to (if applier is
  active) or will connect to (if applier is currently inactive)

Please note that all "tick" values returned do not have a specific unit. Tick
values are only meaningful when compared to each other. Higher tick values mean
"later in time" than lower tick values.

WARNING: calling this method will synchronize data from the collections found
on the remote leader to the local ArangoDB database. All data in the local
collections will be purged and replaced with data from the leader.

Use with caution!

Please also keep in mind that this command may take a long time to complete
and return. This is because it will first do a full data synchronization with
the leader, which will take time roughly proportional to the amount of data.

**Note**: this method is not supported on a Coordinator in a cluster.

is returned if the request was executed successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}

@startDocuBlock put_api_replication_inventory

@brief Returns an overview of collections and their indexes

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/replication/inventory, Return inventory of collections and indexes, handleCommandInventory}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{includeSystem,boolean,optional}
Include system collections in the result. The default value is *true*.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{global,boolean,optional}
Include all databases in the response. Only works on `_system` The default value is *false*.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{batchId,number,required}
A valid batchId is required for this API call

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,optional}
If this parameter is set, the response will be restricted to a single collection (the one
specified), and no views will be returned. This can be used as an optimization to reduce
the size of the response.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the array of collections and their indexes, and the array of views available. These
arrays can be used by replication clients to initiate an initial synchronization with the
server. 
The response will contain all collections, their indexes and views in the requested database
if *global* is not set, and all collections, indexes and views in all databases if *global*
is set.
In case *global* is not set, it is possible to restrict the response to a single collection
by setting the *collection* parameter. In this case the response will contain only information
about the requested collection in the *collections* array, and no information about views
(i.e. the *views* response attribute will be an empty array).

The response will contain a JSON object with the *collections*, *views*, *state* and
*tick* attributes.

*collections* is an array of collections with the following sub-attributes:

- *parameters*: the collection properties

- *indexes*: an array of the indexes of a the collection. Primary indexes and edge indexes
   are not included in this array.

The *state* attribute contains the current state of the replication logger. It
contains the following sub-attributes:

- *running*: whether or not the replication logger is currently active. Note:
  since ArangoDB 2.2, the value will always be *true*

- *lastLogTick*: the value of the last tick the replication logger has written

- *time*: the current time on the server

*views* is an array of available views.

Replication clients should note the *lastLogTick* value returned. They can then
fetch collections' data using the dump method up to the value of lastLogTick, and
query the continuous replication log for log events after this tick value.

To create a full copy of the collections on the server, a replication client
can execute these steps:

- call the */inventory* API method. This returns the *lastLogTick* value and the
  array of collections and indexes from the server.

- for each collection returned by */inventory*, create the collection locally and
  call */dump* to stream the collection data to the client, up to the value of
  *lastLogTick*.
  After that, the client can create the indexes on the collections as they were
  reported by */inventory*.

If the clients wants to continuously stream replication log events from the logger
server, the following additional steps need to be carried out:

- the client should call */logger-follow* initially to fetch the first batch of
  replication events that were logged after the client's call to */inventory*.

  The call to */logger-follow* should use a *from* parameter with the value of the
  *lastLogTick* as reported by */inventory*. The call to */logger-follow* will return the
  *x-arango-replication-lastincluded* which will contain the last tick value included
  in the response.

- the client can then continuously call */logger-follow* to incrementally fetch new
  replication events that occurred after the last transfer.

  Calls should use a *from* parameter with the value of the *x-arango-replication-lastincluded*
  header of the previous response. If there are no more replication events, the
  response will be empty and clients can go to sleep for a while and try again
  later.

**Note**: on a Coordinator, this request must have the query parameter
*DBserver* which must be an ID of a DB-Server.
The very same request is forwarded synchronously to that DB-Server.
It is an error if this attribute is not bound in the Coordinator case.

**Note**: Using the `global` parameter the top-level object contains a key `databases`
under which each key represents a database name, and the value conforms to the above description.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the request was executed successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
is returned if an error occurred while assembling the response.

@brief start the replication applier

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/replication/applier-start, Start replication applier,handleCommandApplierStart}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{global,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, starts the global replication applier for all
databases. If set to *false*, starts the replication applier in the
selected database.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{from,string,optional}
The remote *lastLogTick* value from which to start applying. If not specified,
the last saved tick from the previous applier run is used. If there is no
previous applier state saved, the applier will start at the beginning of the
logger server's log.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Starts the replication applier. This will return immediately if the
replication applier is already running.

If the replication applier is not already running, the applier configuration
will be checked, and if it is complete, the applier will be started in a
background thread. This means that even if the applier will encounter any
errors while running, they will not be reported in the response to this
method.

To detect replication applier errors after the applier was started, use the
*/_api/replication/applier-state* API instead.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the request was executed successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the replication applier is not fully configured or the
configuration is invalid.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
is returned if an error occurred while assembling the response.

@startDocuBlock get_api_wal_access_tail

@brief Fetch recent operations

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/wal/tail, Tail recent server operations, handleCommandTail}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{global,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, tails the WAL for all databases. If set to *false*, tails the 
WAL for the selected database.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{from,number,optional}
Exclusive lower bound tick value for results. On successive calls
to this API you should set this to the value returned
with the *x-arango-replication-lastincluded* header (Unless that header
contains 0).

@RESTQUERYPARAM{to,number,optional}
Inclusive upper bound tick value for results.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{lastScanned,number,optional}
Should be set to the value of the *x-arango-replication-lastscanned* header
or alternatively 0 on first try. This allows the rocksdb engine to break up
large transactions over multiple responses.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{global,boolean,optional}
Whether operations for all databases should be included. When set to *false*
only the operations for the current database are included. The value *true* is
only valid on the *_system* database. The default is *false*.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{chunkSize,number,optional}
Approximate maximum size of the returned result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{syncerId,number,optional}
Id of the client used to tail results. The server will use this to
keep operations until the client has fetched them. Must be a positive integer.
**Note** this or serverId is required to have a chance at fetching reading all
operations with the rocksdb storage engine.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{serverId,number,optional}
Id of the client machine. If *syncerId* is unset, the server will use
this to keep operations until the client has fetched them. Must be a positive
integer.
**Note** this or syncerId is required to have a chance at fetching reading all
operations with the rocksdb storage engine.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{clientInfo,string,optional}
Short description of the client, used for informative purposes only.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns data from the server's write-ahead log (also named replication log). This method can be called
by replication clients after an initial synchronization of data. The method
will return all "recent" logged operations from the server. Clients
can replay and apply these operations locally so they get to the same data
state as the server.

Clients can call this method repeatedly to incrementally fetch all changes
from the server. In this case, they should provide the *from* value so
they will only get returned the log events since their last fetch.

When the *from* query parameter is not used, the server will return log
entries starting at the beginning of its replication log. When the *from*
parameter is used, the server will only return log entries which have
higher tick values than the specified *from* value (note: the log entry with a
tick value equal to *from* will be excluded). Use the *from* value when
incrementally fetching log data.

The *to* query parameter can be used to optionally restrict the upper bound of
the result to a certain tick value. If used, the result will contain only log events
with tick values up to (including) *to*. In incremental fetching, there is no
need to use the *to* parameter. It only makes sense in special situations,
when only parts of the change log are required.

The *chunkSize* query parameter can be used to control the size of the result.
It must be specified in bytes. The *chunkSize* value will only be honored
approximately. Otherwise a too low *chunkSize* value could cause the server
to not be able to put just one log entry into the result and return it.
Therefore, the *chunkSize* value will only be consulted after a log entry has
been written into the result. If the result size is then bigger than
*chunkSize*, the server will respond with as many log entries as there are
in the response already. If the result size is still smaller than *chunkSize*,
the server will try to return more data if there's more data left to return.

If *chunkSize* is not specified, some server-side default value will be used.

The *Content-Type* of the result is *application/x-arango-dump*. This is an
easy-to-process format, with all log events going onto separate lines in the
response body. Each log event itself is a JSON object, with at least the
following attributes:

- *tick*: the log event tick value

- *type*: the log event type

Individual log events will also have additional attributes, depending on the
event type. A few common attributes which are used for multiple events types
are:

- *cuid*: globally unique id of the View or collection the event was for

- *db*: the database name the event was for

- *tid*: id of the transaction the event was contained in

- *data*: the original document data

A more detailed description of the individual replication event types and their
data structures can be found in [Operation Types](#operation-types).

The response will also contain the following HTTP headers:

- *x-arango-replication-active*: whether or not the logger is active. Clients
  can use this flag as an indication for their polling frequency. If the
  logger is not active and there are no more replication events available, it
  might be sensible for a client to abort, or to go to sleep for a long time
  and try again later to check whether the logger has been activated.

- *x-arango-replication-lastincluded*: the tick value of the last included
  value in the result. In incremental log fetching, this value can be used
  as the *from* value for the following request. **Note** that if the result is
  empty, the value will be *0*. This value should not be used as *from* value
  by clients in the next request (otherwise the server would return the log
  events from the start of the log again).

- *x-arango-replication-lastscanned*: the last tick the server scanned while
  computing the operation log. This might include operations the server did not
  returned to you due to various reasons (i.e. the value was filtered or skipped).
  You may use this value in the *lastScanned* header to allow the rocksdb engine
  to break up requests over multiple responses.

- *x-arango-replication-lasttick*: the last tick value the server has
  logged in its write ahead log (not necessarily included in the result). By comparing the the last
  tick and last included tick values, clients have an approximate indication of
  how many events there are still left to fetch.

- *x-arango-replication-frompresent*: is set to _true_ if server returned
  all tick values starting from the specified tick in the _from_ parameter.
  Should this be set to false the server did not have these operations anymore
  and the client might have missed operations.

- *x-arango-replication-checkmore*: whether or not there already exists more
  log data which the client could fetch immediately. If there is more log data
  available, the client could call *logger-follow* again with an adjusted *from*
  value to fetch remaining log entries until there are no more.

  If there isn't any more log data to fetch, the client might decide to go
  to sleep for a while before calling the logger again.

**Note**: this method is not supported on a Coordinator in a cluster.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the request was executed successfully, and there are log
events available for the requested range. The response body will not be empty
in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{204}
is returned if the request was executed successfully, but there are no log
events available for the requested range. The response body will be empty
in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if either the *from* or *to* values are invalid.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
is returned if an error occurred while assembling the response.

@RESTRETURNCODE{501}
is returned when this operation is called on a Coordinator in a cluster.

@brief start a replication

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/replication/sync, Synchronize data from a remote endpoint, handleCommandSync}

@RESTBODYPARAM{endpoint,string,required,string}
the leader endpoint to connect to (e.g. "tcp://192.168.173.13:8529").

@RESTBODYPARAM{database,string,optional,string}
the database name on the leader (if not specified, defaults to the
name of the local current database).

@RESTBODYPARAM{username,string,optional,string}
an optional ArangoDB username to use when connecting to the endpoint.

@RESTBODYPARAM{password,string,required,string}
the password to use when connecting to the endpoint.

@RESTBODYPARAM{includeSystem,boolean,optional,}
whether or not system collection operations will be applied

@RESTBODYPARAM{incremental,boolean,optional,}
if set to *true*, then an incremental synchronization method will be used
for synchronizing data in collections. This method is useful when
collections already exist locally, and only the remaining differences need
to be transferred from the remote endpoint. In this case, the incremental
synchronization can be faster than a full synchronization.
The default value is *false*, meaning that the complete data from the remote
collection will be transferred.

@RESTBODYPARAM{restrictType,string,optional,string}
an optional string value for collection filtering. When
specified, the allowed values are *include* or *exclude*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{restrictCollections,array,optional,string}
an optional array of collections for use with
*restrictType*. If *restrictType* is *include*, only the specified collections
will be synchronized. If *restrictType* is *exclude*, all but the specified
collections will be synchronized.

@RESTBODYPARAM{initialSyncMaxWaitTime,integer,optional,int64}
the maximum wait time (in seconds) that the initial synchronization will
wait for a response from the leader when fetching initial collection data.
This wait time can be used to control after what time the initial synchronization
will give up waiting for a response and fail.
This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Starts a full data synchronization from a remote endpoint into the local
ArangoDB database.

The *sync* method can be used by replication clients to connect an ArangoDB database
to a remote endpoint, fetch the remote list of collections and indexes, and collection
data. It will thus create a local backup of the state of data at the remote ArangoDB
database. *sync* works on a per-database level.

*sync* will first fetch the list of collections and indexes from the remote endpoint.
It does so by calling the *inventory* API of the remote database. It will then purge
data in the local ArangoDB database, and after start will transfer collection data
from the remote database to the local ArangoDB database. It will extract data from the
remote database by calling the remote database's *dump* API until all data are fetched.

In case of success, the body of the response is a JSON object with the following
attributes:

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
This revision-based replication endpoint will only work with the RocksDB
engine, and with collections created in ArangoDB v3.8.0 or later.
{% endhint %}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The name or id of the collection to query.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{batchId,number,required}
The id of the snapshot to use

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns documents by revision

The body of the request should be JSON/VelocyPack and should consist of an
array of string-encoded revision IDs:

```
[
  <String, revision>,
  <String, revision>,
  ...
  <String, revision>
]
```

In particular, the revisions should be sorted in ascending order of their
decoded values.

The result will be a JSON/VelocyPack array of document objects. If there is no
document corresponding to a particular requested revision, an empty object will
be returned in its place.

The response may be truncated if it would be very long. In this case, the
response array length will be less than the request array length, and
subsequent requests can be made for the omitted documents.

Each `<String, revision>` value type is a 64-bit value encoded as a string of
11 characters, using the same encoding as our document `_rev` values. The
reason for this is that 64-bit values cannot necessarily be represented in full
in JavaScript, as it handles all numbers as floating point, and can only
represent up to `2^53-1` faithfully.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The name or id of the collection to query.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{batchId,number,required}
The id of the snapshot to use

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the Merkle tree from the collection.

The result will be JSON/VelocyPack in the following format:
```
{
  version: <Number>,
  branchingFactor: <Number>
  maxDepth: <Number>,
  rangeMin: <String, revision>,
  rangeMax: <String, revision>,
  nodes: [

    { count: <Number>, hash: <String, revision> },
    ...
    { count: <Number>, hash: <String, revision> }
  ]
}
```

At the moment, there is only one version, 1, so this can safely be ignored for
now.

Each `<String, revision>` value type is a 64-bit value encoded as a string of
11 characters, using the same encoding as our document `_rev` values. The
reason for this is that 64-bit values cannot necessarily be represented in full
in JavaScript, as it handles all numbers as floating point, and can only
represent up to `2^53-1` faithfully.

The node count should correspond to a full tree with the given `maxDepth` and
`branchingFactor`. The nodes are laid out in level-order tree traversal, so the
root is at index `0`, its children at indices `[1, branchingFactor]`, and so
on.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The name or id of the collection to query.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{batchId,number,required}
The id of the snapshot to use

@RESTQUERYPARAM{resume,string,optional}
The revision at which to resume, if a previous request was truncated

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the revision IDs of documents within requested ranges

The body of the request should be JSON/VelocyPack and should consist of an
array of pairs of string-encoded revision IDs:

```
[
  [<String, revision>, <String, revision>],
  [<String, revision>, <String, revision>],
  ...
  [<String, revision>, <String, revision>]
]
```

In particular, the pairs should be non-overlapping, and sorted in ascending
order of their decoded values.

The result will be JSON/VelocyPack in the following format:
```
{
  ranges: [
    [<String, revision>, <String, revision>, ... <String, revision>],
    [<String, revision>, <String, revision>, ... <String, revision>],
    ...,
    [<String, revision>, <String, revision>, ... <String, revision>]
  ]
  resume: <String, revision>
}
```

The `resume` field is optional. If specified, then the response is to be
considered partial, only valid through the revision specified. A subsequent
request should be made with the same request body, but specifying the `resume`
URL parameter with the value specified. The subsequent response will pick up
from the appropriate request pair, and omit any complete ranges or revisions
which are less than the requested resume revision. As an example (ignoring the
string-encoding for a moment), if ranges `[1, 3], [5, 9], [12, 15]` are
requested, then a first response may return `[], [5, 6]` with a resume point of
`7` and a subsequent response might be `[8], [12, 13]`.

If a requested range contains no revisions, then an empty array is returned.
Empty ranges will not be omitted.

Each `<String, revision>` value type is a 64-bit value encoded as a string of
11 characters, using the same encoding as our document `_rev` values. The
reason for this is that 64-bit values cannot necessarily be represented in full
in JavaScript, as it handles all numbers as floating point, and can only
represent up to `2^53-1` faithfully.

@brief set configuration values of an applier

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/replication/applier-config, Adjust configuration of replication applier,handleCommandApplierSetConfig}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{global,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, adjusts the configuration of the global replication applier for all
databases. If set to *false*, adjusts the configuration of the replication applier in the
selected database.

@RESTBODYPARAM{endpoint,string,required,string}
the logger server to connect to (e.g. "tcp://192.168.173.13:8529"). The endpoint must be specified.

@RESTBODYPARAM{database,string,required,string}
the name of the database on the endpoint. If not specified, defaults to the current local database name.

@RESTBODYPARAM{username,string,optional,string}
an optional ArangoDB username to use when connecting to the endpoint.

@RESTBODYPARAM{password,string,required,string}
the password to use when connecting to the endpoint.

@RESTBODYPARAM{maxConnectRetries,integer,required,int64}
the maximum number of connection attempts the applier
will make in a row. If the applier cannot establish a connection to the
endpoint in this number of attempts, it will stop itself.

@RESTBODYPARAM{connectTimeout,integer,required,int64}
the timeout (in seconds) when attempting to connect to the
endpoint. This value is used for each connection attempt.

@RESTBODYPARAM{requestTimeout,integer,required,int64}
the timeout (in seconds) for individual requests to the endpoint.

@RESTBODYPARAM{chunkSize,integer,required,int64}
the requested maximum size for log transfer packets that
is used when the endpoint is contacted.

@RESTBODYPARAM{autoStart,boolean,required,}
whether or not to auto-start the replication applier on
(next and following) server starts

@RESTBODYPARAM{adaptivePolling,boolean,required,}
if set to *true*, the replication applier will fall
to sleep for an increasingly long period in case the logger server at the
endpoint does not have any more replication events to apply. Using
adaptive polling is thus useful to reduce the amount of work for both the
applier and the logger server for cases when there are only infrequent
changes. The downside is that when using adaptive polling, it might take
longer for the replication applier to detect that there are new replication
events on the logger server.<br>
Setting *adaptivePolling* to false will make the replication applier
contact the logger server in a constant interval, regardless of whether
the logger server provides updates frequently or seldom.

@RESTBODYPARAM{includeSystem,boolean,required,}
whether or not system collection operations will be applied

@RESTBODYPARAM{autoResync,boolean,optional,}
whether or not the follower should perform a full automatic resynchronization
with the leader in case the leader cannot serve log data requested by the
follower, or when the replication is started and no tick value can be found.

@RESTBODYPARAM{autoResyncRetries,integer,optional,int64}
number of resynchronization retries that will be performed in a row when
automatic resynchronization is enabled and kicks in. Setting this to *0*
will
effectively disable *autoResync*. Setting it to some other value will limit
the number of retries that are performed. This helps preventing endless
retries
in case resynchronizations always fail.

@RESTBODYPARAM{initialSyncMaxWaitTime,integer,optional,int64}
the maximum wait time (in seconds) that the initial synchronization will
wait for a response from the leader when fetching initial collection data.
This wait time can be used to control after what time the initial
synchronization
will give up waiting for a response and fail. This value is relevant even
for continuous replication when *autoResync* is set to *true* because this
may re-start the initial synchronization when the leader cannot provide
log data the follower requires.
This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{connectionRetryWaitTime,integer,optional,int64}
the time (in seconds) that the applier will intentionally idle before
it retries connecting to the leader in case of connection problems.
This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{idleMinWaitTime,integer,optional,int64}
the minimum wait time (in seconds) that the applier will intentionally idle
before fetching more log data from the leader in case the leader has
already sent all its log data. This wait time can be used to control the
frequency with which the replication applier sends HTTP log fetch requests
to the leader in case there is no write activity on the leader.
This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{idleMaxWaitTime,integer,optional,int64}
the maximum wait time (in seconds) that the applier will intentionally idle
before fetching more log data from the leader in case the leader has
already sent all its log data and there have been previous log fetch attempts
that resulted in no more log data. This wait time can be used to control the
maximum frequency with which the replication applier sends HTTP log fetch
requests to the leader in case there is no write activity on the leader for
longer periods. This configuration value will only be used if the option
*adaptivePolling* is set to *true*.
This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{requireFromPresent,boolean,required,}
if set to *true*, then the replication applier will check
at start whether the start tick from which it starts or resumes replication is
still present on the leader. If not, then there would be data loss. If
*requireFromPresent* is *true*, the replication applier will abort with an
appropriate error message. If set to *false*, then the replication applier will
still start, and ignore the data loss.

@RESTBODYPARAM{verbose,boolean,required,}
if set to *true*, then a log line will be emitted for all operations
performed by the replication applier. This should be used for debugging replication
problems only.

@RESTBODYPARAM{restrictType,string,required,string}
the configuration for *restrictCollections*; Has to be either *include* or *exclude*

@RESTBODYPARAM{restrictCollections,array,optional,string}
the array of collections to include or exclude,
based on the setting of *restrictType*

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Sets the configuration of the replication applier. The configuration can
only be changed while the applier is not running. The updated configuration
will be saved immediately but only become active with the next start of the
applier.

In case of success, the body of the response is a JSON object with the updated
configuration.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the request was executed successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the configuration is incomplete or malformed, or if the
replication applier is currently running.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
is returned if an error occurred while assembling the response.

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
This route should no longer be used.
It is considered as deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
{% endhint %}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{from,number,optional}
Exclusive lower bound tick value for results.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{to,number,optional}
Inclusive upper bound tick value for results.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{chunkSize,number,optional}
Approximate maximum size of the returned result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{includeSystem,boolean,optional}
Include system collections in the result. The default value is *true*.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns data from the server's replication log. This method can be called
by replication clients after an initial synchronization of data. The method
will return all "recent" log entries from the logger server, and the clients
can replay and apply these entries locally so they get to the same data
state as the logger server.

Clients can call this method repeatedly to incrementally fetch all changes
from the logger server. In this case, they should provide the *from* value so
they will only get returned the log events since their last fetch.

When the *from* query parameter is not used, the logger server will return log
entries starting at the beginning of its replication log. When the *from*
parameter is used, the logger server will only return log entries which have
higher tick values than the specified *from* value (note: the log entry with a
tick value equal to *from* will be excluded). Use the *from* value when
incrementally fetching log data.

The *to* query parameter can be used to optionally restrict the upper bound of
the result to a certain tick value. If used, the result will contain only log events
with tick values up to (including) *to*. In incremental fetching, there is no
need to use the *to* parameter. It only makes sense in special situations,
when only parts of the change log are required.

The *chunkSize* query parameter can be used to control the size of the result.
It must be specified in bytes. The *chunkSize* value will only be honored
approximately. Otherwise a too low *chunkSize* value could cause the server
to not be able to put just one log entry into the result and return it.
Therefore, the *chunkSize* value will only be consulted after a log entry has
been written into the result. If the result size is then bigger than
*chunkSize*, the server will respond with as many log entries as there are
in the response already. If the result size is still smaller than *chunkSize*,
the server will try to return more data if there's more data left to return.

If *chunkSize* is not specified, some server-side default value will be used.

The *Content-Type* of the result is *application/x-arango-dump*. This is an
easy-to-process format, with all log events going onto separate lines in the
response body. Each log event itself is a JSON object, with at least the
following attributes:

- *tick*: the log event tick value

- *type*: the log event type

Individual log events will also have additional attributes, depending on the
event type. A few common attributes which are used for multiple events types
are:

- *cid*: id of the collection the event was for

- *tid*: id of the transaction the event was contained in

- *key*: document key

- *rev*: document revision id

- *data*: the original document data

The response will also contain the following HTTP headers:

- *x-arango-replication-active*: whether or not the logger is active. Clients
  can use this flag as an indication for their polling frequency. If the
  logger is not active and there are no more replication events available, it
  might be sensible for a client to abort, or to go to sleep for a long time
  and try again later to check whether the logger has been activated.

- *x-arango-replication-lastincluded*: the tick value of the last included
  value in the result. In incremental log fetching, this value can be used
  as the *from* value for the following request. **Note** that if the result is
  empty, the value will be *0*. This value should not be used as *from* value
  by clients in the next request (otherwise the server would return the log
  events from the start of the log again).

- *x-arango-replication-lasttick*: the last tick value the logger server has
  logged (not necessarily included in the result). By comparing the the last
  tick and last included tick values, clients have an approximate indication of
  how many events there are still left to fetch.

- *x-arango-replication-checkmore*: whether or not there already exists more
  log data which the client could fetch immediately. If there is more log data
  available, the client could call *logger-follow* again with an adjusted *from*
  value to fetch remaining log entries until there are no more.

  If there isn't any more log data to fetch, the client might decide to go
  to sleep for a while before calling the logger again.

**Note**: this method is not supported on a Coordinator in a cluster.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the request was executed successfully, and there are log
events available for the requested range. The response body will not be empty
in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{204}
is returned if the request was executed successfully, but there are no log
events available for the requested range. The response body will be empty
in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if either the *from* or *to* values are invalid.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
is returned if an error occurred while assembling the response.

@RESTRETURNCODE{501}
is returned when this operation is called on a Coordinator in a cluster.

@startDocuBlock get_api_control_pregel_status

@brief Get the status of a Pregel execution

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/control_pregel/{id}, Get Pregel job execution status}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{id,number,required}
Pregel execution identifier.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the current state of the execution, the current global superstep, the
runtime, the global aggregator values as well as the number of sent and
received messages.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
HTTP 200 will be returned in case the job execution id was valid and the state is
returned along with the response.

@RESTREPLYBODY{state,string,required,string}
State of the execution. The following values can be returned:
- `"running"`: Algorithm is executing normally.
- `"storing"`: The algorithm finished, but the results are still being written
  back into the collections. Occurs only if the store parameter is set to true.
- `"done"`: The execution is done. In version 3.7.1 and later, this means that
  storing is also done. In earlier versions, the results may not be written back
  into the collections yet. This event is announced in the server log (requires
  at least info log level for the `pregel` log topic).
- `"canceled"`: The execution was permanently canceled, either by the user or by
  an error.
- `"fatal error"`: The execution has failed and cannot recover.
- `"in error"` (currently unused): The execution is in an error state. This can be
  caused by DB-Servers being not reachable or being non responsive. The execution
  might recover later, or switch to `"canceled"` if it was not able to recover
  successfully. 
- `"recovering"` (currently unused): The execution is actively recovering, will
  switch back to `running` if the recovery was successful.

@RESTREPLYBODY{gss,number,required,string}
The number of global supersteps executed.

@RESTREPLYBODY{totalRuntime,number,required,float}
Total runtime of the execution up to now (if the execution is still ongoing).

@RESTREPLYBODY{startupTime,number,required,float}
Startup runtime of the execution.
The startup time includes the data loading time and can be substantial.
The startup time will be reported as 0 if the startup is still ongoing.

@RESTREPLYBODY{computationTime,number,required,float}
Algorithm execution time. The computation time will be reported as 0 if the 
computation still ongoing.

@RESTREPLYBODY{storageTime,number,optional,float}
Time for storing the results if the job includes results storage.
The storage time be reported as 0 if storing the results is still ongoing.

@RESTREPLYBODY{reports,object,optional,get_api_control_pregel_reports}
Statistics about the Pregel execution. The value will only be populated once
the algorithm has finished.

@RESTSTRUCT{vertexCount,get_api_control_pregel_reports,integer,optional,int64}
Total number of vertices processed.

@RESTSTRUCT{edgeCount,get_api_control_pregel_reports,integer,optional,int64}
Total number of edges processed.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
An HTTP 404 error is returned if no Pregel job with the specified execution number
is found or the execution number is invalid.

@EXAMPLES

Get the execution status of a Pregel job:

@startDocuBlock delete_api_control_pregel_cancel

@brief Cancel an ongoing Pregel execution

@RESTHEADER{DELETE /_api/control_pregel/{id}, Cancel Pregel job execution}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{id,number,required}
Pregel execution identifier.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Cancel an execution which is still running, and discard any intermediate
results. This will immediately free all memory taken up by the execution, and
will make you lose all intermediary data.

You might get inconsistent results if you requested to store the results and
then cancel an execution when it is already in its `"storing"` state (or
`"done"` state in versions prior to 3.7.1). The data is written multi-threaded
into all collection shards at once. This means there are multiple transactions
simultaneously. A transaction might already be committed when you cancel the
execution job. Therefore, you might see some updated documents, while other
documents have no or stale results from a previous execution.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
HTTP 200 will be returned in case the job execution id was valid.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
An HTTP 404 error is returned if no Pregel job with the specified execution number
is found or the execution number is invalid.

@EXAMPLES

Cancel a Pregel job to stop the execution or to free up the results if it was
started with `"store": false` and is in the done state:

@brief Start the execution of a Pregel algorithm

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/control_pregel, Start Pregel job execution}

@RESTBODYPARAM{algorithm,string,required,string}
Name of the algorithm. One of:
- `"pagerank"` - Page Rank
- `"sssp"` - Single-Source Shortest Path
- `"connectedcomponents"` - Connected Components
- `"wcc"` - Weakly Connected Components
- `"scc"` - Strongly Connected Components
- `"hits"` - Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search
- `"effectivecloseness"` - Effective Closeness
- `"linerank"` - LineRank
- `"labelpropagation"` - Label Propagation
- `"slpa"` - Speaker-Listener Label Propagation

@RESTBODYPARAM{graphName,string,optional,string}
Name of a graph. Either this or the parameters `vertexCollections` and
`edgeCollections` are required.
Please note that there are special sharding requirements for graphs in order
to be used with Pregel.

@RESTBODYPARAM{vertexCollections,array,optional,string}
List of vertex collection names.
Please note that there are special sharding requirements for collections in order
to be used with Pregel.

@RESTBODYPARAM{edgeCollections,array,optional,string}
List of edge collection names.
Please note that there are special sharding requirements for collections in order
to be used with Pregel.

@RESTBODYPARAM{params,object,optional,}
General as well as algorithm-specific options.

The most important general option is "store", which controls whether the results
computed by the Pregel job are written back into the source collections or not.

Another important general option is "parallelism", which controls the number of
parallel threads that will work on the Pregel job at most. If "parallelism" is not
specified, a default value may be used. In addition, the value of "parallelism"
may be effectively capped at some server-specific value.

The option "useMemoryMaps" controls whether to use disk based files to store
temporary results. This might make the computation disk-bound, but allows you to
run computations which would not fit into main memory. It is recommended to set
this flag for larger datasets.

The attribute "shardKeyAttribute" specifies the shard key that edge collections are
sharded after (default: `"vertex"`).

@RESTDESCRIPTION
To start an execution you need to specify the algorithm name and a named graph
(SmartGraph in cluster). Alternatively you can specify the vertex and edge
collections. Additionally you can specify custom parameters which vary for each
algorithm, see [Pregel - Available Algorithms](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/graphs-pregel.html#available-algorithms).

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
HTTP 200 is returned in case the Pregel was successfully created and the reply
body is a string with the `id` to query for the status or to cancel the
execution.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
An HTTP 400 error is returned if the set of collections for the Pregel job includes
a system collection, or if the collections to not conform to the sharding requirements
for Pregel jobs.

@RESTRETURNCODE{403}
An HTTP 403 error is returned if there are not sufficient privileges to access
the collections specified for the Pregel job.


@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
An HTTP 404 error is returned if the specified "algorithm" is not found, or the
graph specified in "graphName" is not found, or at least one the collections 
specified in "vertexCollections" or "edgeCollections" is not found.

@EXAMPLES

Run the Weakly Connected Components (WCC) algorithm against a graph and store
the results in the vertices as attribute `component`:

@brief Create a new graph in the graph module.

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/gharial, Create a graph}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
The creation of a graph requires the name of the graph and a
definition of its edges.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
define if the request should wait until everything is synced to disc.
Will change the success response code.

@RESTBODYPARAM{name,string,required,string}
Name of the graph.

@RESTBODYPARAM{edgeDefinitions,array,optional,graph_edge_definition}
An array of definitions for the relations of the graph.
Each has the following type:

@RESTBODYPARAM{orphanCollections,array,optional,string}
An array of additional vertex collections.
Documents within these collections do not have edges within this graph.

@RESTBODYPARAM{isSmart,boolean,optional,}
Define if the created graph should be smart (Enterprise Edition only).

@RESTBODYPARAM{isDisjoint,boolean,optional,}
Whether to create a Disjoint SmartGraph instead of a regular SmartGraph
(Enterprise Edition only).

@RESTBODYPARAM{options,object,optional,post_api_gharial_create_opts}
a JSON object to define options for creating collections within this graph.
It can contain the following attributes:

@RESTSTRUCT{smartGraphAttribute,post_api_gharial_create_opts,string,optional,}
Only has effect in Enterprise Edition and it is required if isSmart is true.
The attribute name that is used to smartly shard the vertices of a graph.
Every vertex in this SmartGraph has to have this attribute.
Cannot be modified later.

@RESTSTRUCT{numberOfShards,post_api_gharial_create_opts,integer,required,}
The number of shards that is used for every collection within this graph.
Cannot be modified later.

@RESTSTRUCT{replicationFactor,post_api_gharial_create_opts,integer,required,}
The replication factor used when initially creating collections for this graph.
Can be set to `"satellite"` to create a SatelliteGraph, which will ignore
*numberOfShards*, *minReplicationFactor* and *writeConcern*
(Enterprise Edition only).

@RESTSTRUCT{writeConcern,post_api_gharial_create_opts,integer,optional,}
Write concern for new collections in the graph.
It determines how many copies of each shard are required to be
in sync on the different DB-Servers. If there are less then these many copies
in the cluster a shard will refuse to write. Writes to shards with enough
up-to-date copies will succeed at the same time however. The value of
*writeConcern* can not be larger than *replicationFactor*. _(cluster only)_

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
Is returned if the graph could be created and waitForSync is enabled
for the `_graphs` collection, or given in the request.
The response body contains the graph configuration that has been stored.

The response code.

@RESTREPLYBODY{graph,object,required,graph_representation}
The information about the newly created graph.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
Is returned if the graph could be created and waitForSync is disabled
for the `_graphs` collection and not given in the request.
The response body contains the graph configuration that has been stored.

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}

@brief Add a new edge definition to the graph

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/gharial/{graph}/edge, Add edge definition}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Adds an additional edge definition to the graph.

This edge definition has to contain a *collection* and an array of
each *from* and *to* vertex collections.  An edge definition can only
be added if this definition is either not used in any other graph, or
it is used with exactly the same definition. It is not possible to
store a definition "e" from "v1" to "v2" in the one graph, and "e"
from "v2" to "v1" in the other graph.

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{graph,string,required}
The name of the graph.

@RESTBODYPARAM{collection,string,required,string}

This could be because it is ill-formed, or
if the definition is used in an other graph with a different signature.

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
Flag if there was an error (true) or not (false).
It is true in this response.

The name of the graph.

@RESTURLPARAM{collection,string,required}
The name of the vertex collection the vertex belongs to.

@RESTURLPARAM{vertex,string,required}
The *_key* attribute of the vertex.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{rev,string,optional}
Must contain a revision.
If this is set a document is only returned if
it has exactly this revision.
Also see if-match header as an alternative to this.

@RESTHEADERPARAMETERS

@RESTHEADERPARAM{if-match,string,optional}
If the "If-Match" header is given, then it must contain exactly one Etag. The document is returned,
if it has the same revision as the given Etag. Otherwise a HTTP 412 is returned. As an alternative
you can supply the Etag in an query parameter *rev*.

@RESTHEADERPARAM{if-none-match,string,optional}
If the "If-None-Match" header is given, then it must contain exactly one Etag. The document is returned,
only if it has a different revision as the given Etag. Otherwise a HTTP 304 is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
Returned if the vertex could be found.

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
Flag if there was an error (true) or not (false).
It is false in this response.

@RESTREPLYBODY{code,integer,required,}
The response code.

@RESTREPLYBODY{vertex,object,required,vertex_representation}
The complete vertex.

@RESTRETURNCODE{304}
Returned if the if-none-match header is given and the
currently stored vertex still has this revision value.
So there was no update between the last time the vertex
was fetched by the caller.

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
Flag if there was an error (true) or not (false).
It is true in this response.

@RESTREPLYBODY{code,integer,required,}
The response code.
