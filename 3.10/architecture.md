## What deployment modes are available?

ArangoDB can be deployed in a variety of configurations, depending on your needs.

You can deploy it on-premises as a single server, optionally as a resilient pair
with asynchronous replication and automatic failover, or as a
cluster comprised of multiple nodes with synchronous replication and automatic
failover for high availability and resilience. For the highest level of data
safety, you can additionally set up off-site replication for your entire cluster.

important details about each mode and the included features.

## Deploying by technology

You can deploy ArangoDB manually, using the ArangoDB Starter tool, in Docker
containers, or using the ArangoDB Kubernetes Operator.
