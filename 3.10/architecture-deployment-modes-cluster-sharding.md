Sharding
========

ArangoDB organizes its collection data in _shards_. Sharding allows to use
multiple machines to run a cluster of ArangoDB instances that together
constitute a single database system.

Sharding is used to distribute data across physical machines in an ArangoDB
Cluster. It is a method to determine the optimal placement of documents on
individual DB-Servers.

This enables you to store much more data, since ArangoDB distributes the data
automatically to the different servers. In many situations one can also reap a
benefit in data throughput, again because the load can be distributed to
multiple machines.

Using sharding allows ArangoDB to support deployments with large amounts of
data, which would not fit on a single machine. A high rate of write / read
operations or AQL queries can also overwhelm a single servers RAM and disk
capacity.

There are two main ways of scaling a database system:
- Vertical scaling
- Horizontal scaling

Vertical scaling scaling means to upgrade to better server hardware (faster
CPU, more RAM / disk). This can be a cost effective way of scaling, because
administration is easy and performance characteristics do not change much.
Reasoning about the behavior of a single machine is also a lot easier than
having multiple machines. However at a certain point larger machines are either
not available anymore or the cost becomes prohibitive.

Horizontal scaling is about increasing the number of servers. Servers typically
being based on commodity hardware, which is readily available from many
different Cloud providers. The capability of each single machine may not be
high, but the combined the computing power of these machines can be arbitrarily
large. Adding more machines on-demand is also typically easier and more
cost-effective than pre-provisioning a single large machine. Increased
complexity in infrastructure can be managed using modern containerization and
cluster orchestrations tools like [Kubernetes](deployment-kubernetes.html).

To achieve this ArangoDB splits your dataset into so called _shards_. The number
of shards is something you may choose according to your needs. Proper sharding
is essential to achieve optimal performance. From the outside th process of
splitting the data and assembling it again is fully transparent and as such we
achieve the goals of what other systems call "master-master replication".

An application may talk to any _Coordinator_  and it will automatically figure
out where the data is currently stored (read-case) or is to be stored
(write-case). The information about the _shards_ is shared across all
_Coordinators_ using the _Agency_.

_Shards_ are configured per _collection_ so multiple _shards_ of data form the
_collection_ as a whole. To determine in which _shard_ the data is to be stored
ArangoDB performs a hash across the values. By default this hash is being
created from the `_key` document attribute.

Every shard is a local collection on any _DB-Server_, that houses such a shard
as depicted above for our example with 5 shards and 3 replicas. Here, every
leading shard _S1_ through _S5_ is followed each by 2 replicas _R1_ through _R5_.
The collection creation mechanism on ArangoDB _Coordinators_ tries to best
distribute the shards of a collection among the _DB-Servers_. This seems to
suggest, that one shards the data in 5 parts, to make best use of all our
machines. We further choose a replication factor of 3 as it is a reasonable
compromise between performance and data safety. This means, that the collection
creation ideally distributes 15 shards, 5 of which are leaders to each 2
replicas. This in turn implies, that a complete pristine replication would
involve 10 shards which need to catch up with their leaders.

Not all use cases require horizontal scalability. In such cases, consider the
[OneShard](architecture-deployment-modes-cluster-architecture.html#oneshard)
feature as alternative to flexible sharding.

Shard Keys
----------

ArangoDB uses the specified _shard key_ attributes to determine in which shard
a given document is to be stored. Choosing the right shard key can have
significant impact on your performance can reduce network traffic and increase
performance.

![Hash Sharding](images/cluster_sharding_hash.jpg)

ArangoDB uses consistent hashing to compute the target shard from the given
values (as specified via by the `shardKeys` collection property). The ideal set
of shard keys allows ArangoDB to distribute documents evenly across your shards
and your _DB-Servers_. By default ArangoDB uses the `_key` field as a shard key.
For a custom shard key you should consider a few different properties:

- **Cardinality**: The cardinality of a set is the number of distinct values
  that it contains. A shard key with only _N_ distinct values can not be hashed
  onto more than _N_ shards. Consider using multiple shard keys, if one of your
  values has a low cardinality.

- **Frequency**: Consider how often a given shard key value may appear in
  your data. Having a lot of documents with identical shard keys will lead
  to unevenly distributed data. 

This means that a single shard could become a bottleneck in your cluster.
The effectiveness of horizontal scaling is reduced if most documents end up in
a single shard. Shards are not divisible at this time, so paying attention to
the size of shards is important.

Consider both frequency and cardinality when picking a shard key, if necessary
consider picking multiple shard keys.

### Configuring Shards

The number of _shards_ can be configured at collection creation time, e.g. in
the Web UI or via _arangosh_:

```js
db._create("sharded_collection", {"numberOfShards": 4, "shardKeys": ["country"]});
```

The example above, where `country` has been used as _shardKeys_ can be useful
to keep data of every country in one shard, which would result in better
performance for queries working on a per country base.

It is also possible to specify multiple `shardKeys`.

Note however that if you change the shard keys from their default `["_key"]`,
then finding a document in the collection by its primary key involves a request
to every single shard. However this can be mitigated: All CRUD APIs and AQL
support using the shard key values as a lookup hints. Just send them as part
of the update / replace or removal operation, or in case of AQL, that
you use a document reference or an object for the UPDATE, REPLACE or REMOVE
operation which includes the shard key attributes:

```js
UPDATE { _key: "123", country: "…" } WITH { … } IN sharded_collection
```

If custom shard keys are used, one can no longer prescribe the primary key value of
a new document but must use the automatically generated one. This latter
restriction comes from the fact that ensuring uniqueness of the primary key
would be very inefficient if the user could specify the primary key.

On which DB-Server in a Cluster a particular _shard_ is kept is undefined.
There is no option to configure an affinity based on certain _shard_ keys.

For more information on shard rebalancing and administration topics please have
a look in the [Cluster Administration](administration-cluster.html) section.

### Indexes On Shards

Unique indexes on sharded collections are only allowed if the fields used to 
determine the shard key are also included in the list of attribute paths for the index:

| shardKeys | indexKeys |             |
|----------:|----------:|------------:|
| a         | a         |     allowed |
| a         | b         | not allowed |
| a         | a, b      |     allowed |
| a, b      | a         | not allowed |
| a, b      | b         | not allowed |
| a, b      | a, b      |     allowed |
| a, b      | a, b, c   |     allowed |
| a, b, c   | a, b      | not allowed |
| a, b, c   | a, b, c   |     allowed |

High Availability
-----------------

A cluster can still read from a collection if shards become unavailable for
some reason. The data residing on the unavailable shard cannot be accessed,
however reads on other shards will still succeed.

In a production environment you should always deploy your collections with a
*replicationFactor* greater than *1* to ensure that the shard stays available
even when a machine fails.

Storage Capacity
----------------

The cluster will distribute your data across multiple machines in your cluster.
Every machine will only contain a subset of your data. Thus the cluster now has
the combined storage capacity of all your machines.

Please note that increasing the replication factor also increases the space
required to keep all your data in the cluster.
