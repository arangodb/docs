# Working with Inverted Indexes

{% hint 'info' %}
If you use ArangoSearch caching in supported 3.9 versions and upgrade an
Active Failover deployment to 3.10, you may need to re-configure the
cache-related options and thus recreate inverted indexes and Views. See
[Known Issues in 3.10](../release-notes-known-issues310.html#arangosearch).
