API Changes in ArangoDB 3.10
============================

This document summarizes the HTTP API changes and other API changes in ArangoDB 3.10.
The target audience for this document are developers who maintain drivers and
integrations for ArangoDB 3.10.

## HTTP RESTful API

### Privilege changes

### Endpoint return value changes

Since ArangoDB 3.8, there have been two APIs for retrieving the metrics in two different formats: `/_admin/metrics` and `/_admin/metrics/v2`. The metrics API v1 (`/_admin/metrics`) was deprecated in 3.8 and the usage of `/_admin/metrics/v2` was encouraged.  
In ArangoDB 3.10, `/_admin/metrics` and `/_admin/metrics/v2` now behave identically and return the same output in a fully Prometheus-compatible format. The old metrics format is not available anymore.

For the metrics APIs at `/_admin/metrics` and `/_admin/metrics/v2`, unnecessary spaces have been removed between the "}" delimiting the labels and the value of the metric.


### Endpoints added

Added the `GET /_api/query/rules` endpoint that returns the available
optimizer rules for AQL queries. It returns an array of objects that contain
the name of each available rule and its respective flags.

The JavaScript API was not extended, but you can make a request using a
low-level method in _arangosh_:

```js
arango.GET("/_api/query/rules")
```

### Endpoints augmented

APIs that return data from ArangoDB's write-ahead log (WAL) may now return
collection truncate markers in the cluster, too. Previously such truncate
markers were only issued in the single server and active failover modes, but not
in a cluster. Client applications that tail ArangoDB's WAL are thus supposed
to handle WAL markers of type `2004`.

The following HTTP APIs are affected:
* `/_api/wal/tail`
* `/_api/replication/logger-follow`

#### Cursor API

The cursor API can now return two additional statistics values in its `stats` subattribute:

* *cursorsCreated*: the total number of cursor objects created during query execution. Cursor
  objects are created for index lookups.
* *cursorsRearmed*: the total number of times an existing cursor object was repurposed. 
  Repurposing an existing cursor object is normally more efficient compared to destroying an 
  existing cursor object and creating a new one from scratch.

These attributes are optional and only useful for detailed performance analyses.

#### Index API

The index creation API at POST `/_api/index` now accepts an optional `storedValues` 
attribute to include additional attributes in a persistent index.
These additional attributes cannot be used for index lookups or sorts, but they
can be used for projections.
If set, `storedValues` must be an array of index attribute paths. There must be no
overlap of attribute paths between `fields` and `storedValues`. The maximum number
of values is 32.

All index APIs that return additional data about indexes (e.g. GET `/_api/index`)
will now also return the `storedValues` attribute for indexes that have their
`storedValues` attribute set.

The extra index information is also returned by inventory-like APIs that return
the full set of collections with their indexes.
