API Changes in ArangoDB 3.10
============================

This document summarizes the HTTP API changes and other API changes in ArangoDB 3.10.
The target audience for this document are developers who maintain drivers and
integrations for ArangoDB 3.10.

## HTTP RESTful API

### Privilege changes

### Endpoint return value changes

Since ArangoDB 3.8, there have been two APIs for retrieving the metrics in two different formats: `/_admin/metrics` and `/_admin/metrics/v2`. The metrics API v1 (`/_admin/metrics`) was deprecated in 3.8 and the usage of `/_admin/metrics/v2` was encouraged.  
In ArangoDB 3.10, `/_admin/metrics` and `/_admin/metrics/v2` now behave identically and return the same output in a fully Prometheus-compatible format. The old metrics format is not available anymore.

For the metrics APIs at `/_admin/metrics` and `/_admin/metrics/v2`, unnecessary spaces have been removed between the "}" delimiting the labels and the value of the metric.
