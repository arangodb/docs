# How to Use the Documentation

The documentation is split into five parts:

- This manual describes ArangoDB and its features in detail for you as a user,
  developer, administrator, and data scientist.
- The [AQL handbook](aql/) explains ArangoDB's query language AQL.
- The [HTTP handbook](http/) describes the public REST API of ArangoDB
  that is used to communicate with clients. In general, the HTTP handbook will be
  of interest to driver developers. If you use any of the existing drivers for
  the language of your choice, you can skip this part.
- The [Driver handbook](drivers/) includes the documentation of the
  available official ArangoDB drivers and integrations, and an overview of the community
  drivers.
- The [ArangoDB Oasis handbook](oasis/) guides you through the user interface
  of our cloud service to set up organizations, projects and deployments.
