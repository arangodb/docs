### arangobench

Changed flag name from `--concurrency` to `--threads`.

The following deprecated arangobench testcases have been removed from _arangobench_:
* `aqltrx`
* `aqlv8`
* `counttrx`
* `deadlocktrx`
* `multi-collection`
* `multitrx`
* `random-shapes`
* `shapes`
* `shapes-append`
* `skiplist`
* `stream-cursor`

These test cases had been deprecated since ArangoDB 3.9.

The testcase `hash` was renamed to `persistent-index` to better reflect its
scope.
