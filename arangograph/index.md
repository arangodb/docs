# ArangoGraph Insights Platform

The [ArangoGraph Insights Platform](https://cloud.arangodb.com/home?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=cluster_pages&utm_campaign=docs_traffic){:target="_blank"},
formerly called Oasis, provides ArangoDB databases as a Service (DBaaS).
It enables you to use the entire functionality of an ArangoDB cluster
deployment without the need to run or manage the system yourself.

  healthy by monitoring them 24/7.

- ensures that your databases are kept up to date by
  installing new versions without service interruption.

- ensures that your data is safe by providing encryption &
  audit logs and making frequent data backups.

- guarantees that your data always remains your property and
  access to it is protected with industry standard safeguards.
